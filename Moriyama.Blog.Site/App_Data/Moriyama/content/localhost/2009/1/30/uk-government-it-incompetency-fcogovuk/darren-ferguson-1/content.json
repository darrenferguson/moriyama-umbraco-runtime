    "bodyText": "@adz - My friends had to fill out the extra information in pen onto the printed form.\n\nI don't agree with your opinion that complaining changes nothing. I often find that if you put something in writing in front of someone senior you'll make them aware of a problem they never knew existed. I'd prefer to try and do something than do nothing.\n\nI agree with you that local government is shit I've contracted in government departments in a few different countries.",

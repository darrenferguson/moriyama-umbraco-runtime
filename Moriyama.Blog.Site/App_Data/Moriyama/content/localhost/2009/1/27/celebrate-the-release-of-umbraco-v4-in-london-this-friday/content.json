    "bodyText": "<p><img alt=\"Beer\" class=\"top\" src=\"/media/77584/2661_1.jpg\" /></p><p>As you may be aware <a href=\"http://www.umbraco.org/\">Umbraco 4</a> is scheduled for release this Friday. Niels and Per are out in Copenhagen having a few beers to celebrate this milestone. Not wanting to be outdone a few of us over here in London are up for joining the celebrations and indulging in a shandy or two of our own.</p><p>If you want to come along, add a comment below or tweet with the hashtag #umbraobeerslondon. Weâ€™ll only go ahead if there is enough interest (say 6-10 people). With Niels offering to provide a beer or two for us there should be a <strong>free pint</strong> involved. Venue to be confirmed.</p><p>Hopefully see you all on Friday.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> As of 11.30am on Thurs we are Myself, Lesley, Hendy + 1, Billy. If we get to 10 people before 8pm this eve we'll be on @ <a href=\"http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/pubsandbars/101-bar-info-16223.html\">Bar 101</a> at 6.30pm, otherwise we'll cancel and try and arrange something another time. </p><p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> I think we'll cancel as there aren't enough confirmed. If anyone wants to do another time let me know and I'll start a forum topic.</p>",

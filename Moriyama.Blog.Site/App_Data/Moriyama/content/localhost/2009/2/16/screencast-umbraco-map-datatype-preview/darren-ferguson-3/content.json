    "bodyText": "Hi Tom,\n\nI'd add multiple maps in different content nodes and use an XSLT Macro to render all of these locations to a single map on your front end website.\n\nIf you start adding multiple locations to a single datatype you need somewhere to store a description of each location - opening hours if it is a store location etc - whereas ordinarily they can just be properties of the datatype.\n\nIt all becomes very un-Umbraco like and messy. If you have any suggestions as to how this would work, I'd love to here them. The project has a suggestions forum on our.umbraco.org: http://our.umbraco.org/projects/google-maps-datatype\n",

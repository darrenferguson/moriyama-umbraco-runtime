    "bodyText": "Hi,\n\nIs this IE compatible? It could be the particular corporate rollout of IE I am forced to use, but the part of the script that defers loading doesn't appear to be working for me. If I rework o.loadScripts to execute as 'fire and forget', it works for me, but obviously if I could get deferring to work, that would be ideal.\n\nGreat stuff, I'm looking forward to digging into it.\n\nChris",

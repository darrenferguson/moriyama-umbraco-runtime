    "bodyText": "<p>In February Kas Thomas blogged <a href=\"http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1518-A-reality-checklist-for-vendors\">\r\nA reality checklist for (CMS) vendors</a> which was picked up by\r\nMichael Marth at day.com and turned into the <a href=\"http://dev.day.com/microsling/content/blogs/main/cmsvendormeme.html\">\r\nCMS Vendor Meme</a> - I guess most of my readers are familiar with\r\nthe term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme\">meme</a>. Over\r\ntime various ECM vendors were 'tagged' and responded\r\naccordingly.</p><p>As a long term independent TeamSite consultant I waited for a\r\nresponse from Interwoven which came courtesy of <a href=\"http://interwovenblog.com/2009/03/22/the-cms-vendor-meme/\">Tom\r\nWentworth's Blog</a>.</p><p>All of the blog posts made for interesting reading and Tom's\r\nresponse was open and honest - however all of the viewpoints being\r\nblogged were from the vendors themselves and therefore had some\r\nobvious bias.</p><p>Yesterday I found a blog post from <a href=\"http://www.reddotcmsblog.com/cms-vendor-meme\">Adrian\r\nMateljan</a> which gave an alternative response to the meme. Adrian\r\nanswered the meme drawing upon his experience as RedDot CMS\r\ndeveloper. I'm unable to work out from Adrian's site whether he has\r\nany connections with RedDot or whether his point of view is an\r\nindependent one but the post inspired me to give some feedback on\r\nthe Autonomy/Interwoven response.</p><p>By way of disclosure I've been working with TeamSite for over 8\r\nyears and I have represented Interwoven on client sites in previous\r\nyears but not for the last couple of years. All of my opinions\r\nrelate to TeamSite version 6.5 and are not relevant to any of the\r\nother diverse range of software that that they vend.</p><p>Tom W didn't see fit to score himself on each point as the meme\r\nsuggested so I'll suggest one where I feel qualified to do so.</p><p><strong>1. Our software comes with an installer\r\nprogram.</strong></p><p>Yep. GUI and command line versions. Simplicity itself.</p><p>My score: 5/5</p><p><strong>2. Installing or uninstalling our software does not\r\nrequire a reboot of your machine.</strong></p><p>Nope, but like Tom I question how useful this really is. In my\r\nexperience if you are installing/uninstalling/servive packing and\r\nECM system then you'd expect some downtime.</p><p>My score: N/A</p><p><strong>3. You can choose your locale and language at install\r\ntime, and never have to see English again after that.</strong></p><p>I'd never tried that before. Simple, as Tom says. I've just\r\nlearned that French for logout is \"Se d√©connecter\".</p><p>One point, if you customise the GUI and add custom menu Items\r\nyou don't appear to be able to \"localise\" those. I'm also pretty\r\nsure that when you build a data capture template in TeamSite you'd\r\nneed to create a copy for each locale in order that field names are\r\ndisplayed in the appropriate language. You could workaround this\r\nusing TeamSite inline callouts in the data capture template but\r\nthis would mean custom localisation code.</p><p>My Score: 3/5</p><p><strong>4. Eval versions of the latest edition(s) of our\r\nsoftware are always available for download from the company\r\nwebsite.</strong></p><p>No. This has long been a frustration of mine. Your customer\r\nsupport account allows you to download the products that you are\r\nlicensed to use from the support website. As an independent\r\nconsultant there is no way I can try out new products/upgrades and\r\nservice packs myself in order to recommend them to a client.</p><p>My Score: 0/5</p><p><strong>5. Our WCM software comes with a fully templated \"sample\r\nweb site\" and sample workflows, which work\r\nout-of-the-box.</strong></p><p>I agree with Tom about the example workflows. They cover some\r\nsample scenarios for content publishing/deployment and I have often\r\nused them with minimal modification.</p><p>I've never used the \"Component Guide\" that Tom refers to. I'm\r\nnot sure if it ships with TeamSite or LiveSite there is an example\r\nTemplating directory which contains a lot of files and\r\ndocumentation but I've never needed them.</p><p>My Score: Not qualified to comment!</p><p><strong>6. We ship a tutorial.</strong></p><p>Absolutely, see above.</p><p><strong>7. You can raise a support issue via a button, link, or\r\nmenu command in our administrative interface.</strong></p><p>No, but I don't see the point of this. You go to\r\nsupport.interwoven.com, login and file your issue. As a developer\r\nyou could customise the TeamSite GUI and add a link to the support\r\nsite which would satisfy this requirement. From my perspective I\r\nwouldn't want end users raising support issues to the vendor as\r\nmore often than not they won't be able to distinguish between a bug\r\nin the product and a bug in our customisation of the product.\r\nNormally issues are reported to an internal development team who\r\nescalate to the vendor as appropriate.</p><p>My Score: N/A</p><p><strong>8. All help files and documentation for the product are\r\nlaid down as part of the install.</strong></p><p>As Tom says, \"Help files, yes.  Documentation, no\". The\r\ndocs are available to download as a single bundle from the support\r\nwebsite or can be viewed online.</p><p>My Score: N/A</p><p><strong>9. We run our entire company website using the latest\r\nversion of our own WCM products.</strong></p><p>Take Tom's word for it.</p><p>My Score: 5</p><p><strong>10. Our salespeople understand how our products\r\nwork.</strong></p><p>My *very limited* experience of Interwoven sales suggests that\r\nthey understand the company product suite very well and how each\r\nproduct integrates with the others. They also seem to be a\r\ntight-knit company and the communication between sales and\r\nengineering seems to work, when there is something they are unsure\r\nof they'll go to the right person and get you an answer pretty\r\nquickly.</p><p>My Score: Not qualified to comment!</p><p><strong>11. Our software does what we say it does.</strong></p><p>Very general question. I always find the <a href=\"http://www.interwoven.com/components/page.jsp?topic=PRODUCT::TEAMSITE\">\r\nmarketing blurb</a> very high level and fluffy, but then it isn't\r\nreally targeted at me.</p><p>My Score: N/A</p><p><strong>12. We don't charge extra for our SDK.</strong></p><p>No.</p><p>My Score: 5/5</p><p><strong>13. Our licensing model is simple enough for a\r\n5-year-old to understand.</strong></p><p>Agree with Tom \"Since when do 5 year olds buy enterprise\r\nsoftware?\". I don't really get involved pre-sales.</p><p>My Score: N/A</p><p><strong>14. We have one price sheet for all\r\ncustomers.</strong></p><p>Tom says Yes</p><p>My Score: 5/5</p><p><strong>15. Our top executives are on Skype, Twitter, or some\r\nsimilar channel, and: <em>Feel free to contact them directly at any\r\ntime.</em></strong></p><p>Not sure I need to get in touch with 'top executives'. I think a\r\nbetter point would be to question whether it is easy to get in\r\ntouch with the right people easily, e.g. developers able to contact\r\nsupport. I do know that most Interwoven customers have a dedicated\r\naccount manager who can put them in touch with whoever they\r\nneed.</p><p>Maybe Kas needs to clarify why he is asking this question. It is\r\ngood to See Tom Wentworth on twitter and blogging regularly. I just\r\nwish Interwoven would give a little love to their <a href=\"http://devnet.interwoven.com\">developer portal</a> which is\r\nmissing a few very basic features.</p><p>My Score: N/A</p><p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p><p>I hope this made an interesting read an offered an alternative\r\nviewpoint on Autonomy/Interwoven's meme response.</p><p>Having stated that CMS vendors should \"Violate these rules at\r\nyour own risk\" I wish that Kas Thomas could possibly follow up on\r\nhis <a href=\"http://www.cmswatch.com/Trends/1518-A-reality-checklist-for-vendors\">\r\noriginal post</a> and let some of us who have been following know\r\nwhy he thought that some of the points that he raised are so\r\nimportant.</p><p>9c56d0fcf93175d70e1c9b9d188167cf</p>",

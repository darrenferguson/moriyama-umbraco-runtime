    "bodyText": "Haha, I get those too from time to time.\n\nI usually tell them: \"If you think my services are expensive, it must mean you think you can get the same service cheaper elsewhere. I wish you good luck with that. In fact, please tell me who it is, so I can start hiring them too\".\n\nPeople usually get the point with that.\n\nIn my 15+ years of experience, people who argue too much over price your price is almost always the same people who are \"time wasters\", and trying to get a lot more put into a project that you originally agreed upon.\n\nI myself am quite offended when people think I'm trying to score a ton of money off them. No, I honestly tell you what I think is needed and what it costs.\n\nThey really don't get me or what my business is about.\n\nSo I fully support your rant! But I choose not to get annoyed by those prospective customers, and instead reject & ignore them as quickly as possible.",

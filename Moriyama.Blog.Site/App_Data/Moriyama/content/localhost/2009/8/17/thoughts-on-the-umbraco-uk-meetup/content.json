It was a great day and as is usual for me\r\nat these events the highlight was to be able to put names to the\r\nfaces of people who I've interacted with via email and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/darrenferguson\">twitter</a>.</p><p>I should have sat down and written my thoughts the day after but\r\nI've lazily let time drift and everyone else has gone about writing\r\nup the event in the meantime.</p><p>Paul Marden of <a href=\"http://www.orcare.com/\">Orcare</a> has\r\ndone a great job of putting together <a href=\"http://www.orcare.com/about/news/umbraco-open-source-net-community-grows-in-uk.aspx\">\r\na press release</a> about the event. <a href=\"http://jonontech.com/\">Jon Marks</a> at LBi and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/bijeshtank\">Bijesh Tank</a> have also\r\nwritten up some thoughts <a href=\"http://jonontech.com/2009/08/14/umbraco-beer-and-frenemies/\">here</a>\r\nand <a href=\"http://www.lbiq.net/technology/umbraco-day-lbi/\">here</a>.</p><p>As with any Umbraco event, <a href=\"http://www.percipientstudios.com/\">Doug Robar's</a> camera\r\nwas present and some great pictures are available to <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=umbracouk&amp;w=all\">view on\r\nflickr</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/ashallcross01\">Adam Shallcross</a>\r\nand the guys at <a href=\"http://thecogworks.co.uk/\">Cogworks</a>\r\nput together some great artwork for a one off Umbraco London\r\nt-shirt (as pictured). This artwork has now been adapted to use as\r\n<a href=\"http://thecogworks.co.uk/our-services/umbraco/umbraco-goodies\">\r\nscreensavers and desktop background</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://twitter.com/uniquelau\">Laurence Gillian</a> and\r\nthe team at <a href=\"http://www.voodoodog.com/\">Vodoodog</a> also\r\ncreate some stunning <a href=\"http://umbtop.voodoodog.com/\">desktop\r\nbackgrounds</a> and made them available to download.</p><p>On the day we were also helped out by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mobragauk\">Mo Braga</a> and Bijesh from\r\nLBi, <a href=\"http://hartvig.com\">Niels</a> who added some real\r\nvalue to the day by coming and talking about Umbraco. <a href=\"http://twitter.com/roekens\">Gregory Roekens</a> CTO of <a href=\"http://www.wunderman.com/\">Wunderman</a> also joined Niels\r\nand Doug to form our expert Umbraco panel for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Adam Shallcross, <a href=\"http://twitter.com/readingdancer\">Chris Houston</a> and\r\nGregory Roekens were also kind enough to step up and present some\r\nof their latest Umbraco innovations in an open demonstration\r\nslot.</p><p>Finally we need to thank Jon Marks for picking up on my\r\nspeculative tweet looking for a venue and suggesting LBi as a\r\nvenue.</p><p>No thanks to the London weather for dumping down a months worth\r\nof rain in the space of a few hours. But all in all a great day\r\nout.</p><p>Oh and I almost forgot, I think I conquered my fear of public\r\nspeaking after dashing about in front of the crowd all day, so if\r\nyou want me to come and talk about Umbraco or anything else, do let\r\nme know.</p><p>Finally, there was lots of talk along the lines of \"We should do\r\nthis more often\", so I'm encouraging all of you who attended to\r\ncome along to the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/London-CMS/\">Last\r\nThursday CMS beers</a> from time to time. I'm going to try and go\r\nalong for the first time myself this month.</p>",

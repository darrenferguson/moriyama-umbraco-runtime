    "tags": "Umbraco, Judicial Event, Health Medical Pharma",
    "bodyText": "<p>I've added Umbraco 4.0.2.1 to my <a href=\"http://autoumbraco.darren-ferguson.com/\">Umbraco trials\r\nsite</a>. There are 2 distributions, a clean install and one with\r\nthe latest version of Warren Buckley's CWS website starter package.\r\nIn the next day or two I'll add a pimped distribution containing\r\nall packages from the Umbraco package repository. You can of course\r\nInstall the packages into the clean distribution should you\r\nwish.</p><p>For those of you who haven't used my Umbraco trials site, it\r\nallows you to create a hosted installation of Umbraco in a single\r\nclick. There are no limitations on the install, you have full admin\r\naccess and can install packages as you wish. The trials expire\r\nafter a short period and are useful for showing someone Umbraco for\r\nthe first time or evaluating a package that you don't wish to\r\ninstall into your production environment without testing.</p><p>The Umbraco trials site has been relatively successful to date\r\nserving up more than 300 trials to more than 200 users.</p><p>Now, back to trying to prepare some stuff for codegarden. See\r\nyou all next week.</p>",

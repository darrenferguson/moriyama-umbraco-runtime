    "bodyText": "Hi Darren,\n\nI have just installed your Google Map doc type and it installed seamlessly, so well done :)\n\nDo you have an example of how to show multiple items on a single map? I have a collection of point which I would like to display on a single page and then if the user clicks the marker I need it needs to change the content of a DIV on the page (probably using AJAX) If you have an example of multiple node usage that would be a great step in the right direction!\n\nCheers,\n\nChris",

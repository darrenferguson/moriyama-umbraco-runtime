    "bodyText": "Another vote for del.icio.us - I used to use Foxmarks but found delicious to be much better.  Firebug is excellent, as is the Google notifer (but on OSX there are other, non FF replacements - Twitter(iffic) and Google Notifier in the menubar).\n\nI also recommend AdBlock.\n\nBut for Umbraco users - \"Its all Text!\" is fantastic.  It allows you to edit text on a web page using your favourite editor.\nSo for example, if editing CSS or XSLT in Umbraco on Windows, you would right-click and open the text in Visual Studio, edit in Visual Studio, then save it back to Umbraco.\nTry it - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4125",

    "bodyText": "<p>\r\nI've created a package to check for broken links in Umbraco pages. You can download it <a href=\"/media/12892/ferguson_moriyama_link_checker_1.0.umb\">here</a>.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile reading through some of the notes on open space sessions conducted as part of codegarden day 2 I saw this requested as a 'most wanted' package. I remembered that I had the code to do this from a couple of years ago, so I cleaned it up a little and decided to release it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe package is implemented as an Umbraco action handler. When you publish a node, it's content is scanned for broken links. If any are found then a report is emailed to the document publisher. You need to have Umbraco configured so it is able to send email.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe package will handle external links as well as internal absolute and relative links.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs ever, thoughts, suggestions, comments and feature requests are all welcome.\r\n</p>",

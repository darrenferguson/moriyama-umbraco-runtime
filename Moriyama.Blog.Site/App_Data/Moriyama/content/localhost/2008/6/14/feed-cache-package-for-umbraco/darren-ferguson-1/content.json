Just specifying the feed URL as file:///c:/path/to/feed.xml should be fine.\r\n\r\n@Thomas - No reason why it couldn't do that. At the moment only GET is supported, so would have to extend it slightly to be able to post a request. Let me know if you are interested and we can discuss, maybe on the forum.",

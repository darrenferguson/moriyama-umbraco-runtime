    "bodyText": "Darren - works a treat! Been using subversion with unfuddle.com for my own projects for a while now after our conversations at the level two course and I spend a bit of time manually attaching/detaching the db on each commit/update. This saves me doing that each time and also ensures that I have versioned backups of my database just like my code.\nI wonder is there a way of creating a start-of-day and end-of-day wonder script that will include this step and also kick off your svn checkout or update...\nThanks for the tip!\n\nDavid",

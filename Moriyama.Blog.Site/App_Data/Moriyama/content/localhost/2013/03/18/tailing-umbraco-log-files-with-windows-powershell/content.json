    "bodyText": "<p>I've read a few people looking for an alernative to the Umbraco trace to help them to debug when using the new Umbraco MVC rendering engine.</p>\n<p>The wonderfully namedÂ <em><a href=\"http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/how-tos\">umbDebugShowTrace</a></em> query string has no effect when using the MVC rendering engine - because the information that it provided isn't available. As discussed in my <a href=\"/2013/02/22/log4net-logging-from-your-custom-code-in-umbraco/\" title=\"Log4net logging from your custom code in Umbraco\">previous blog post</a> we now have log4net available in Umbraco.</p>\n<p>In the previous post I shared tips on how to place your own debug messages in their own log4net file - but for the predominantly lazy (I include myself in this group) there is a simple <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/bb978526.aspx\">Powershell</a> command to help out:</p>\n<pre>cat UmbracoTraceLog.txt -wait | select-string \"string to find\"\n</pre>\n<p>To break this down <em>cat UmbracoTraceLog.txt</em> just dumps the contents of the Umbraco log file to the console (cat is an alias of the <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/hh849787.aspx\">Get-Content Cmdlet</a>). The <em>-wait</em> flag keeps the command running appending new output to the console as it is added to the file.</p>\n<p>Lastly we can pipe the output of the command to it is filtered only to lines that contain specific text <em>| select-string \"string to find\" -</em> this could be the name of a particular class or namespace that you wanted to watch.</p>\n<p>Note: \"string to find\" can be a regular expression if you want to do complicated inclusion or exclusion of log messages.</p>\n<p>The output you get looks something like this:</p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width: 100% !important; height: auto;\" src=\"/media/133053/17-03-2013_10-56-10.jpg\" alt=\"Tailing Umbraco log files with Windows PowerShell\" /></p>\n<p style=\"clear: both;\">If you have a dual screen setup it works nicely to have your browser on one screen and this one the other.</p>",

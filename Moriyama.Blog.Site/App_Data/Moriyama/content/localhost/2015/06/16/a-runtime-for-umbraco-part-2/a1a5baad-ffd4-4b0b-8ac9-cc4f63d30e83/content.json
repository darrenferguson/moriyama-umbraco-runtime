Would love to contribute.<br/><br/>Did you ever consider adding controllers based on node type alias? When looking into this myself I lifted some logic from Matt Brailsford's Karbon it's one of the features I really like from Umbraco core and I'll admit that's where I got stuck when trying to create this kind of a solution, you really have to detach any logic away from UmbracoCms.Core entirely."

    "bodyText": "I just came across your Runtime articles, inadvertently, while searching for Umbraco custom logging.<br/><br/>We have been doing the same using Solr as the repository instead of flat files. We have had a couple of sites up for a few years and it is working out pretty well on Umbraco 4.  One difference is we spit out a minimum of template from the initial request/response and the rest of the site fills itself in with javascript requests.  WE would probably use more caching and less JS next time. <br/><br/>I am in the process of building a new site in this style on Umbraco 7 and I had really thought about using Node on the front-end but I may have to use c#/mvc due to time/budget contraints.  Finding your posts was very timely! This go-round <br/><br/>I am happy to see you have taken this a step further and packaged it up (I am right in the middle of doing the same thing almost exactly like this!).  We use the Solr platform on www.steamboatchamber.com and www.vvf.org. I look forward to seeing more posts... and using the Node implementation to seed my own version."

Firstly 'Saigon City Restaurant' doesn't serve Bun\r\nBo Hue but they did offer to make it for us if we gave them enough\r\nnotice. This is an offer we will have to take up in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanh Binh had a noodle soup dish on the menu, but sadly it was\r\ntiny, massively over priced and was like someone had dumped sunday\r\nroast beef into a bowl of average stock and vermicelli noodles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanh Binh does not cater for Vietnamese and sadly it seems like\r\neverything has been westernised and targeted at the top end of the\r\nCambridge restaurant scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good for: Sorry.....<br />\r\nBad for: Tiny portion, expensive and not very good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/darrenferguson/374462801/\"\r\ntitle=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"/media/77424/2146_2.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" alt=\"Thanh Binh - Two and a half chilli rated\"/></a></p>\r\n",

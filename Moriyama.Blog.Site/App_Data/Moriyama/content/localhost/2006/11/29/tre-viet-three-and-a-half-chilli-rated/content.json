It was the busiest\r\nSaturday lunchtime venue we have ever visited and about 80% of the\r\ndiners were Vietnamese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dish was good but not great. The beef was pretty poor and\r\nvery fatty, and for a 'Hue' there was not much heat at all. We\r\nadded a large amount of chilli sauce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stock was flavoursome, but only really had a meaty taste,\r\nthe herb infusion that makes a stock special was lacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Good for:</em> Busy with local Vietnamese.<br />\r\n <em>Bad for:</em> Bad fatty beef. No real spice in the stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/darrenferguson/309670572/\"\r\ntitle=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"/media/77080/2112_2.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"312\" alt=\"Tre Viet Three and a half chilli rated\"/></a></p>\r\n",

    "bodyText": "<p>\r\nI've been hearing a lot of buzz about Ruby on Rails, so I finally got down to running through the tutorial at: <a href=\"http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html\">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/01/20/rails.html</a></p><p>\r\nPretty impressive I must say, but the jury will be out until I get to try and build something ‘real world’ with it. This might not be for a while, as all of my spare ‘geek’ spare time is being invested in <a href=\"http://www.umbraco.org\">Umbraco</a> at the moment. \r\n</p><p>\r\nI am pretty sure it would handle any of the web projects that usually land at my feet, but it always comes down to whether I ‘like’ it or not. \r\n</p><p>\r\nAlso, I did a brief search for UK based shared hosting packages that support ROR and only managed to find one.\r\n</p>",

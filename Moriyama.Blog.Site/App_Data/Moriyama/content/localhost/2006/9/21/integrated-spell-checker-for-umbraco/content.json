    "bodyText": "<p>I'd avoided looking at spell checking in Umbraco as I thought it would quite time consuming. </p><p>I was wrong... Thanks to the excellent <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/netspell/\">NetSpell</a> and it's built in web ui demo, it only took about 30 minutes to hack something together.</p><p>Check out the <a href=\"http://www.fergusonmoriyama.com/Spell/spelling.htm\">screencast</a>.</p><p>The checker works on dictionary files, so it will do languages other than English. I implemented it to check specific Umbraco fields, though it would be relatively simple to have it check all fields in a document type.</p><p>I'm hoping Niels will snap this one up and integrate it, as I'm not known for my UI design!</p><p>Next on the list is looking at <a href=\"http://nclassifier.sourceforge.net/\">NClassifier</a> which <a href=\"http://ismail.umbraco.net\">Ismail</a> found. I'm hoping that it will help me add some content intelligence to Umbraco - for example, auto suggesting keywords and document summaries.</p>",

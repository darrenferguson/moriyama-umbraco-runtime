Our Wayne just \r\nwasn't quite up to it when the pressure was on.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI have plenty of complaints and a overwhelming feeling of injustice, but I try to be dignified in defeat and won't say any more.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI must be getting old, I am used to this feeling. I'll be back up on my feet and smiling again in 3 or 4 days.  \r\n</p>",

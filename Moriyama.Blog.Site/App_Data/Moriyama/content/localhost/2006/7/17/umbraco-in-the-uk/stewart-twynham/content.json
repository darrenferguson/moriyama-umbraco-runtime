    "bodyText": "Hi Darren,\r\n\r\nI'm based up here in (sunny!) Manchester and am delighted with Umbraco... despite having developed using linux / CGI / perl / php for over a decade, I've been a convert to C#.net over the last few years.  Other .net based CMS platforms such as DNN and Rainbow simply don't give you the 100% control over the HTML that Umbraco does.\r\nI'm now looking to launch Umbraco based sites for several customers where accessibility / SEO / etc are critical.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nStewart",

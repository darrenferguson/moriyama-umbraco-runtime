    "bodyText": "Love this restaurant!! I went there countless times, tried pretty much everything :P .I wouldnt really chose Ph? here over other tasty main courses. they did a great special meal on new years day ;)\r\nHowever I always feel a bit sleepy after a while there. prob bcause of their lack of light (on purpose). Anyway I would recommend SaigonSaigon to everyone.",

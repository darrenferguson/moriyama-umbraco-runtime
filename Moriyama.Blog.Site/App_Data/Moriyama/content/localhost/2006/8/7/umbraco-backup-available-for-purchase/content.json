    "bodyText": "<p>\r\nAlthough Umbraco backup is still in beta, I've opened up the <a href=\"/backup/order.aspx\">buy now link</a> as the code that takes the backup is stable and backups will be compatible with future releases. You will need to <a href=\"/backup/signup.aspx\">register</a> first.\r\n</p><p>\r\nI anticipate finishing FTP and Virtual directory support later tonight. Restore tools and the manual should follow by the end of the week.\r\n</p><p>\r\nStart backing up today!\r\n</p>",

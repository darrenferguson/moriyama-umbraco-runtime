in the forum as I need to provide a list of people to the venue on
the day.</p><p><strong>We need your help!</strong></p><p>Although most of the practical details are in place there is
plenty the Umbraco community can do to support this event.</p><p><strong>Give a presentation</strong></p><p>If you think that you have a compelling talk/presentation to
give at the event, please leave some details on <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/codegarden-A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/umbraco-uk-meetup/topicspresentations">

#umbracouk.</p><p>Non Umbracians are welcome there will be plenty of beginner
focused material. If you know any CMS professionals who may be
interested in Umbraco get them to come along.</p><p><strong>Come along prepared to participate</strong></p><p>We don't want the meet-up to be a bunch of guys standing up and
talking we want to have group sessions and may be some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology">open
space</a>. Come along prepared to speak up, with questions and
topics around Umbraco in mind.</p><p><strong>Finally</strong></p><p>Without community partcipation this event will just be some tech
guys in a room. By contributing to the wiki pages above and
throwing your suggestions into the ring we can make it something
much more than that.</p>]]></bodyText>

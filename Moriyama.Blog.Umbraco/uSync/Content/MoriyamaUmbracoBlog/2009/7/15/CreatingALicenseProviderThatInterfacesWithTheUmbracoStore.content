  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>At codegarden 09 I attended an open space session that discussed
the three current package repositories - our.umbraco projects, the
Umbraco package repository and the Umbraco store. My action point
from this discussion was to write up some information on how to
create a license provider that works with the Umbraco store. With
this in mind I've released my <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/projects/umbraco-store-license-provider">
framework for creating licenses</a> on our.umbraco.org and also
created a wiki page which <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/how-tos/creating-a-license-provider-that-interfaces-with-the-umbraco-store">
explains how to configure the application</a>.</p><p>The application is written around spring.net and is easy to get
up and quickly. It is also very flexible allowing you to implement
some simple interfaces in several areas of the application where
you may want to customise functionality. Integration testing is
already completed and my framework already provides licenses for
two products in the <a href="http://store.umbraco.org/">Umbraco
store</a>.</p>]]></bodyText>

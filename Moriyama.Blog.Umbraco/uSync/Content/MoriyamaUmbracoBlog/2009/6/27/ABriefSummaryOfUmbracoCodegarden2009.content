  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>I'm back from Umbraco codegarden A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2 in Copenhagen with the
obligatory sunburn. I'm a lot lighter in the wallet but enriched
and nourished in terms of ideas and inspiration for web CMS.</p><p>As the title says, this is a brief summary. I just sat down and
wrote up all of my mental notes from the conference and I realise
that I have more to do than I honestly have time for. I've
prioritised everything so that the commitments I made in open space
sessions are top of the list.</p><p>Unfortunately for me Umbraco makes less than 5% of my
professional commitments so time is very precious but I've left
codegarden this year vowing to increase that 5% because I've
realised that I want to work with Umbraco a lot more.</p><p>One of the ways to achieve this increase in Umbraco time is
commercial packages. I attended an open space session on
integrating the three current package repositories - store,
our.umbraco and the original package repository - and out of this
<a href="http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/codegarden-A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/open-space-minutes/integrating-the-3-package-repositories">
the minutes</a> show that I have a few actions. First I aim to
document some best practices for creating commercial packages and
secondly I'll release my framework application that allows you to
quickly write some license providers that work with the Umbraco
store by implementing some .net interfaces.</p><p>Some may argue that by promoting commercial packages I'm not
really entering the spirit of the whole Umbraco and open source
movement but my answer is simple. If I had an employer subsidising
my Umbraco development then everything that I created would be
free. Unfortunately that is just not the case. I'll still continue
to release free Umbraco packages alongside my commercial
offerings.</p><p>Continuing my focus on working more with Umbraco I attended open
space sessions on <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/codegarden-A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/open-space-minutes/umbraco-support">
Umbraco support</a> and <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/codegarden-A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/open-space-minutes/team-development">
Team development</a> and at other sessions I got the answers from
the core team that I needed in order to try and present Umbraco as
a viable option for my larger financial services clients.</p><p>I've made a commitment to work more with Umbraco this year. I've
set myself certain personal goals that I will asses on a regular
basis to see if what I am trying to achieve is working.</p><p>So that was my personal codegarden experience. Some other
highlights for me were:</p><ul><li>Launch of <a href="http://our.umbraco.org">our.umbraco.org</a>
proving that Umbraco love their community</li><li>Putting faces to the names of all of those people (let's do a
UK meet soon).</li><li>Discovering that I love open space. It isn't just for
conference organisers who can't be bothered!</li><li>Great organic lunches and a fantastic venue that encouraged
creativity.</li></ul><p>A couple of other points from the keynote that I can't really
leave out:</p><ul><li>Umbraco 4.1 will be a native .net 3.5 application, with a few
interesting new features.</li><li>Umbraco 5 will be a rewrite using asp.net MVC and not backwards
compatible with previous releases.</li><li>Umbraco 4.1 will be stable and supported post release of
Umbraco 5.</li></ul><p>So that was it codegarden. Thanks guys. See you all again next
year I hope.</p><p>I'm going to get on to my to do list now. Watch this space.</p>]]></bodyText>

  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>I've added Umbraco 4.0.2.1 to my <a href="http://autoumbraco.darren-ferguson.com/">Umbraco trials
site</a>. There are 2 distributions, a clean install and one with
the latest version of Warren Buckley's CWS website starter package.
In the next day or two I'll add a pimped distribution containing
all packages from the Umbraco package repository. You can of course
Install the packages into the clean distribution should you
wish.</p><p>For those of you who haven't used my Umbraco trials site, it
allows you to create a hosted installation of Umbraco in a single
click. There are no limitations on the install, you have full admin
access and can install packages as you wish. The trials expire
after a short period and are useful for showing someone Umbraco for
the first time or evaluating a package that you don't wish to
install into your production environment without testing.</p><p>The Umbraco trials site has been relatively successful to date
serving up more than 300 trials to more than 200 users.</p><p>Now, back to trying to prepare some stuff for codegarden. See
you all next week.</p>]]></bodyText>

also helped to organise. It was a great day and as is usual for me
at these events the highlight was to be able to put names to the
faces of people who I've interacted with via email and <a href="http://twitter.com/darrenferguson">twitter</a>.</p><p>I should have sat down and written my thoughts the day after but
I've lazily let time drift and everyone else has gone about writing
up the event in the meantime.</p><p>Paul Marden of <a href="http://www.orcare.com/">Orcare</a> has
done a great job of putting together <a href="http://www.orcare.com/about/news/umbraco-open-source-net-community-grows-in-uk.aspx">
a press release</a> about the event. <a href="http://jonontech.com/">Jon Marks</a> at LBi and <a href="http://twitter.com/bijeshtank">Bijesh Tank</a> have also
written up some thoughts <a href="http://jonontech.com/A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/08/14/umbraco-beer-and-frenemies/">here</a>
and <a href="http://www.lbiq.net/technology/umbraco-day-lbi/">here</a>.</p><p>As with any Umbraco event, <a href="http://www.percipientstudios.com/">Doug Robar's</a> camera
was present and some great pictures are available to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=umbracouk&amp;w=all">view on
flickr</a>.</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/ashallcross01">Adam Shallcross</a>
and the guys at <a href="http://thecogworks.co.uk/">Cogworks</a>
put together some great artwork for a one off Umbraco London
t-shirt (as pictured). This artwork has now been adapted to use as
<a href="http://thecogworks.co.uk/our-services/umbraco/umbraco-goodies">
screensavers and desktop background</a>.</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/uniquelau">Laurence Gillian</a> and
the team at <a href="http://www.voodoodog.com/">Vodoodog</a> also
create some stunning <a href="http://umbtop.voodoodog.com/">desktop
backgrounds</a> and made them available to download.</p><p>On the day we were also helped out by <a href="http://twitter.com/mobragauk">Mo Braga</a> and Bijesh from
LBi, <a href="http://hartvig.com">Niels</a> who added some real
value to the day by coming and talking about Umbraco. <a href="http://twitter.com/roekens">Gregory Roekens</a> CTO of <a href="http://www.wunderman.com/">Wunderman</a> also joined Niels
and Doug to form our expert Umbraco panel for Q&amp;A.</p><p>Adam Shallcross, <a href="http://twitter.com/readingdancer">Chris Houston</a> and
Gregory Roekens were also kind enough to step up and present some
of their latest Umbraco innovations in an open demonstration
slot.</p><p>Finally we need to thank Jon Marks for picking up on my
speculative tweet looking for a venue and suggesting LBi as a
venue.</p><p>No thanks to the London weather for dumping down a months worth
of rain in the space of a few hours. But all in all a great day
out.</p><p>Oh and I almost forgot, I think I conquered my fear of public
speaking after dashing about in front of the crowd all day, so if
you want me to come and talk about Umbraco or anything else, do let
me know.</p><p>Finally, there was lots of talk along the lines of "We should do
this more often", so I'm encouraging all of you who attended to
come along to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-CMS/">Last
Thursday CMS beers</a> from time to time. I'm going to try and go
along for the first time myself this month.</p>]]></bodyText>

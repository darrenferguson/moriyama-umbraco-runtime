  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>It isn't often I get frustrated enough to write a ranting blog
post but I've been getting pretty steamed up with some of the
communication I've been getting recently from prospective
clients.</p><p>I get a fair amount of email each week asking me if I'm
interested in working on a project. Luckily I'm privileged to be
busy right now and I'll usually - <em>politely</em> - decline.
Occasionally, if the project seems of interest and I have the time
to commit to it I'll write back outlining some initial thoughts, my
terms of business and importantly my hourly and day rates.</p><p>Some may question the fact that I get down to money so quickly,
but I've become quite adept at spotting emails where budget is
likely to cause issues. Many of these emails even start with
sentences like "I need some cheap Umbraco/TeamSite development
work", so I think it is important to put my rates out there to save
everyone some time.</p><p>Ordinarily if costs are an issue myself and the potential client
agree that our working together on the project in question isn't
going to work out and bid each other a polite good day. From time
to time I'll get a reaction along the lines of "wow, that's
expensive" and I'll usually take the time to explain that a hair
stylist with 15 years experience is likely to give a better haircut
than a trainee barber. This sometimes gets mistaken for arrogance
but I do stand by the metaphor.</p><p>By this point you are probably thinking I'm charging silly
extortionate rates but I'm not. I keep an eye on the market and
charge a good value price that is fair for a contract CMS
architect/developer with 12 years commercial experience.</p><p>So where's the beef? Well, more and more frequently I'm getting
individuals who decide to confront me. These people try to tell me
how to run my business and what I should charge. Here are some
genuine quotes from emails that I've received in the past 6
months.</p><ul><li>"I could get that done for £300 with Joomla" - (A whole
website)</li><li>"You are being ridiculous - nobody will pay that"</li><li>"You should be careful with the recession it is very likely
that you will be out of a job soon"</li><li>"You've wasted my time which I am annoyed about you should be
more realistic about your expectations in future"</li></ul><p>Those are a few of my "favourites" and there are many more but
the point is that I am getting sick of defending myself when I
shouldn't have to.</p><p>In order to end silly and futile process of people trying to
dictate to me how I should earn my living, future such emails will
be responded to with a link to this post and further - negative -
correspondence ignored.</p><p>In case you are reading this as a result of receiving such an
email from me here is all that you need to know. If you don't want
to work with me then that is fine but
<em><strong>never</strong></em> make the mistake of telling me what
I am worth. If budget is an issue and you are prepared to
compromise quality to reduce the price of your project I may even
be able to recommend someone. What I won't do any longer is defend
myself against personal attacks, such attacks will be greeted with
a barrage - <em>of silence</em>.</p>]]></bodyText>

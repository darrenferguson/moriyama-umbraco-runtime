  <bodyText><![CDATA[Haha, I get those too from time to time.

I usually tell them: "If you think my services are expensive, it must mean you think you can get the same service cheaper elsewhere. I wish you good luck with that. In fact, please tell me who it is, so I can start hiring them too".

People usually get the point with that.

In my 15+ years of experience, people who argue too much over price your price is almost always the same people who are "time wasters", and trying to get a lot more put into a project that you originally agreed upon.

I myself am quite offended when people think I'm trying to score a ton of money off them. No, I honestly tell you what I think is needed and what it costs.

They really don't get me or what my business is about.

So I fully support your rant! But I choose not to get annoyed by those prospective customers, and instead reject & ignore them as quickly as possible.]]></bodyText>

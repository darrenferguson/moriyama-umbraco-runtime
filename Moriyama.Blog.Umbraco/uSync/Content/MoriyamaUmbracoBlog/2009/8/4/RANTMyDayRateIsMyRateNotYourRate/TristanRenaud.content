  <bodyText><![CDATA[I have always been extremely in favor of high daily rates because - as you wrote - "my rate is my rate not the client's one". We are assuming it. Period. 

The higher the rate is, the better you need to be! A client will demand a lot, I am fine with that. 

And it also means your work is useful to your clients at this rate. We are established and skilled professionals, so no doubt about the fact we are useful to our clients.

In a "2.0" world, transparency and reputation do matter so if you can work at this price, it is just because it is a fair and useful price.

Clients decide with who they work, suppliers decide at what price and what conditions. That's not politically very correct to write, I agree, we are here to serve clients but as a matter of fact, that's just the way things work in this world!

So in conclusion, Yes I do agree with both of you... And thanks for speaking about this issue!

  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>This post should be subtitled "or stop moaning".</p><p>As a pre-cursor to the main content of my post a note to CSS
developers.  <em>Be careful what you set your heart upon.</em>
If IE6 was banished/killed/gone what would differentiate you from
any other web developer? If anyone could pick up a manual and learn
CSS, and all browsers rendered your markup exactly as intended
would that not render your x years of experience redundant?
Wouldn't the market become saturated with talentless newbies who
could do your job just as well as you could? Wouldn't rates of
remuneration inevitably plummet? Is that what you really want?</p><p>Do you not think in some way that you enjoy the challenge of
those quirks and frustrations that IE6 cause you? Isn't that what
sets you apart from the crowd and makes you are craftsman? Sure,
everybody loves to moan from time to time it's a human condition -
but do you really mean it?</p><p>Having gotten that out of the way, let me state clearly that I
would like to see the end of IE6 too. Although I rarely get hands
on with browsers from day to day I have done in the past. I'm aware
of the frustrations and I think it is a completely legitimate
movement to get people to install modern standards compliant
browsers.</p><p>I take issue with the way people go about it.</p><ol><li>Complain about it on Twitter/blog or some other rant
outlet.</li><li>Drop support.</li><li>Sign up to some silly petition site.</li></ol><p>I'm not too bothered about #1. Everyone needs to let off steam,
but if you find yourself repeatedly ranting about IE6 on twitter it
is probably a sign that it is consuming too much of your time and
you should stand up and do something about it.</p><p>I find #2 concerning. I have quite recently been party to
discussions where developers have seriously contemplated just
dropping support between versions of their product. This simply
isn't on. If you have previously supported IE6, have not informed
your user base that you are dropping IE6 support then you should be
committed to support until such time that you've communicated to
your customer your EOL plan. If you've never supported IE6 or are
some gimmicky web 2.0 site then I guess it is your call.</p><p>Now for #3. We've seen a series of sites recently such as <a href="http://idroppedie6.com/">I dropped IE6</a>, <a href="http://ie6update.com/">IE6 Update</a>, <a href="http://www.ie6nomore.com/">IE6 No more</a> and <a href="http://ie6offenders.com/">IE6 offenders</a>. Each of these -
in their own way - is trying to get people to upgrade their browser
(though the cynic in me says that they are actually just trying to
ride a trending publicity wave).</p><p>I'm not going to theorise over how to get home end users to
upgrade their browsers but I will say that all of these sites are
practically pointless when it comes to breaking through a corporate
IT policy. Here is why:</p><ul><li>Most corporate organisations don't allow their users to install
anything. Privileges on their PC will be locked down to prevent
this.</li><li>Even if a user had admin rights a large percentage of them
wouldn't know how to upgrade their browser so IT would still have
to do the rollout and a 10,000 desk software rollout is
expensive.</li><li>The testing of legacy applications in a new browser could be a
vast expensive and time consuming project in its own right costing
several million (pounds/euros/dollars).</li><li>Do you honestly think your employer cares if you can't watch
youtube at work because your browser isn't up to date?</li><li>Many large corporate organisations will do their security at a
gateway/proxy level rather than addressing browser security issues.
It is much more cost effective.</li></ul><p>Even if your stop IE6 campaign works around all of the points
above, what is out there right now is still painfully thin on real
information on *why* people should upgrade their browser. This
information needs to be clear, concise and readable by someone at
executivelevel. Here is a hint: the CTO isn't going to approve
browser upgrades on the basis that it makes your job easier. The
information out there right now is scant, and presenting a protest
web site URL to your CTO would make you look a bit silly to say the
very least - if you were running for office in your local
elections, would you campaign with a one page manifesto?</p><p>Finally, some of these sites are targeting the wrong people.
Getting a million developers to sign a petition against IE6 is like
trying to convince a million conservatives that Thatcher was a
great woman.</p><p>So what do I suggest? If you are definitely not prepared to wait
for the eventual demise of IE6 and work within a large organisation
that still uses it:</p><ol><li>Prepare some good documentation on why IE6 is bad in executive
friendly language - you could possibly even start an open source
collaboration on such a document.</li><li>Include real information on how IE6 costs your organisation
money on a day to day basis. Wasted dev/testing hours, time spent
patching, blocking sites on the firewall etc.</li><li>Create an internal audience. Circulate your document within
your organisation targeting the most senior people that you have
access to.</li></ol><p>Sure, you'll likely get nowhere but <em>'Tis better to have
loved and lost Than never to have loved at all.</em></p><p>Unfortunately in many many cases software projects are initiated
due to palms being greased and the right people being wined and
dined rather than any practical considerations. This is something
outside of the sway of the lowly developer and unfortunately
sometimes we have to accept that we just aren't that important.</p>]]></bodyText>

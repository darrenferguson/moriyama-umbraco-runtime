  <bodyText><![CDATA[I agree with almost everything, bar paragraph number one. In it, you sound like a clergyperson defending religion on the basis that its demise would cause their unemployment! 
Or a matricidal murder defending itself from the death penalty on compassionate grounds for being an orphan! The victim in this analogy is the user experience.
In Logic this argument is called Fallacy.
Bear in mind that the problem was caused by designers' "expertise" in finding ways to make IE6 to work despite all shortcomings and slipups from the standards. At the end of the day, the world was convinced that IE6 worked and decided to embrace it.
I believe there is a lot more in web designing than spending hours circumventing platform quirks. 
Let IE6 die in peace. Free the web designer. Let's inaugurate an era of good quality web experience. 
And, yeah, from paragraph number two onwards, you present a thoughtful strategy to getting there. 
Great thought-provoking article.

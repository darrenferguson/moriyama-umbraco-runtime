  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.julianwraith.com/">Julian Wraith</a>
recently asked people to contribute to a debate on the <a href="http://www.julianwraith.com/?p=313">future of content
management</a>. While this is an interesting debate I'm going to
attack it from a slightly different angle. I'm looking at it from
the point of view that there are a number of widespread cross
vendor issues that need to be fixed before we start moving
forwards.</p><p>Each example is a real world example. Kudos points if you can
spot the various CMS systems in question (some points apply to
multiple CMS). If your CMS doesn't suffer from any of the following
leave a link to it in my comments, I'd love to evaluate it.</p><p>So, in no particular order:</p><ul><li>I want to access your CMS with my browser but I can't because I
use Firefox and you only support IE.</li><li>I want to roll out your CMS within my organisation, I have to
migrate all of my users to be stored in a database table in a
custom schema defined by your CMS.</li><li>I'm trying to define the layout for a web page using your CMS
but your templating language is completely bespoke and not based on
any standards.</li><li>I've managed to render a webpage using your CMS but you seem to
have added loads of extra div tags all of which have CSS classes
named "crapvendor".</li><li>I'm trying to use your WYSIWYG editor but apparently I need to
install an ActiveX component.</li><li>I've entered some standards compliant markup into your WYSIWYG
editor using the "source view" and it has "corrected it".</li><li>Your CMS doesn't understand the extended character set of my
source document but when I paste from this document it happily
saves these characters to the repository anyway - as question
marks.</li><li>I want to import an image into your CMS - this requires a java
applet. (In fact any java applets for any purpose = bad IMHO)</li><li>I've entered a summary of my content, now I have to manually
enter keywords too.</li><li>I'm performng an operation that takes some time, the status
screen is of the "white" and "blank" variety.</li><li>I've had it with your browser GUI. I want to use Livewriter but
no API exists for me to implement support.</li><li>I've finally managed to create something as complex as a
webpage, now for the 20 step process to publish it. (Admittedly
normally a limitation of the implementation rather than the
CMS).</li><li>I've negotiated above process and the URL of my new page is
/index.php/news/12042984626492732?ver=8.0&amp;this=sucks</li><li>I want to assemble a list of all recent news items in the CMS,
this is half a day of development.</li><li>My site relies heavily on user generated content. I need to set
up a cron job in order to get this user generated content back into
your CMS.</li><li>You believe that "your way" of versioning content is better
than SVN/Git/Sourcesafe.</li><li>Your support engineer just provided a configuration setting to
fix an issues. When I ask where this setting is documented I am
told "it isn't".</li><li>The same serious defect has existed in your software for over 5
years. I personally have reported it on more than 5 occasions each
time I am told to disable the component in question.</li></ul><p>There was a time when <em>some</em> of these were acceptable
scenarios, mainly due to the limitations of technology but leaving
something dated in place because "it works" isn't an acceptable
scenario in my book.</p><p>If you are a vendor who commits one of these crimes against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system">WCM</a>
then I'd love to hear your excuses and intended fix dates. If you
disagree with any of the above being a problem I'd also love to
hear from you.</p><p>6f82f1d997A0307-3A9D-4FEB-94EE-FF6323708EFFdc522545efe863e5d2b73</p>]]></bodyText>

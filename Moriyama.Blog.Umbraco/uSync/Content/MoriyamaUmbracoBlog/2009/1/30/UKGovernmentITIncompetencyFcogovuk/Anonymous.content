  <bodyText><![CDATA[I'd rather preserve my anonymity on this as I raised this with both the client and supplier when the web system was being built. The reasoning has been poorly explained.
The web front end is completely detatched from the back end. Someone copies all the stuff you submit and enters it manually into a second back-office system. That system is a legacy one which isn't standards-based and can't take any variations in character set. But it's also a massive system processing all kinds of immigration data. It's a behemoth that is typical of so many government IT contracts of the last decade, commissioned and designed by muppets. And no one has a real exit strategy.
It is true to say that there will be upgrades and there's a strategic plan to integrate back and front office by 8C5653DD-0D2E-4750-855E-B5FA32A8F716, but that's heavily dependent on government policy and funding. And even if those were in place you know that people will forget to state and prioritise the right requirements.
Having said that, it is true to say that securing a visa is completely independent of the character set issue. So it's poor IT in this case rather than poor business.]]></bodyText>

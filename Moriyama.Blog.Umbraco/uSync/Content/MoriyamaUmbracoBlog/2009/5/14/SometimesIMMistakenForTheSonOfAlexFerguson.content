  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>When I check into a hotel in Asia approximately 1 in 4 times I'm
asked if I'm the son of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Ferguson">Alex
Ferguson</a>. Through gritted teeth, I'll reply that I am the son
of Clive Ferguson and a Liverpool supporter as well.</p><p>Yesterday this "making assumptions based on having the same name
as someone thing" went a little further than the normal polite
enquiry at a hotel reception desk. My email inbox contained a
message from <em>7cristiano7.</em></p><blockquote><p>Hello Sir, My name is and am 16 years old. I live in Liberia. I
have three years now trying to get help from people to play
football in Europe mainly in England, but so far found no one yet.
Sir am kid who sees only football ahead of my life. Knowing that
you are a son of Sir Alex, i therfore neel in tears for you to help
play football in England. I called you months back to ask for this
help but your respond to me like"this is private no. Dont call this
line again" made me afraid and i hung up. Sir if you don't really
understand what am trying to, please permit me to call you and
explain. A lot a people tells me" play football son it is your
call".</p></blockquote><p>I did feel a little guilty because as the email suggests I
didn't give the kid a chance to speak when he called me a few
months back. I assumed that it was another skype call where I'd be
told that I'd won the lottery in Nigeria and all I had to do was
furnish the caller with my bank details in order to receive riches
beyond my wildest dreams.</p><p>So any suggestions on how to advise this kid? I composed the
following draft which I am yet to send.</p><blockquote><p>You have the wrong person, I am not Sir Alex Ferguson's son. I
just have the same name.<br />
Good luck with your football career.</p><p><br />
If you are any good, I'd suggest you play for Liverpool.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>Darren "son of Clive" Ferguson</p></blockquote>]]></bodyText>

<a href="http://www.interwoven.com/templatedata/events/gearup_A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/iwov/index.html">
Autonomy Interwoven gearup</a> at <a href="http://www.claridges.co.uk/">Claridges</a> in London.
Interwoven were recently <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=NEWS::RELEASES&amp;dcr=templatedata/announcement/press-release/data/A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/dcr-autonomy.xml">
acquired by Autonomy</a> and as an independent Interwoven
consultant with nearly 10 years experience I was keen to learn
about the Autonomy product suite and how their integration into the
Interwoven product suite would affect my day to day work.</p><p><strong>An Introduction:</strong></p><p>The day was presented in a slick style with an even slicker
accompanying audio/visual presentations - I counted six AV
technicians seated behind a black screen at the back of the room.
The audience was a mix of technical, sales and marketing people
from Autonomy Interwoven partners and customers. The tone was very
marketing based - the whole day was really about how to to increase
revenue through your website using Autonomy products. A large
proportion of the audience wanted something different, in an
interactive vote at the end of the day 38% of the audience voted
that they'd like to see "more technical content" at the next
gearup, twice the percentage of any other option.</p><p>Throughout the day I felt that the confidence of some of the
presenters bordered on arrogance we were told that "Interwoven
invented web content management" and there were constant references
to Autonomy technology being market leading with "no competitors".
Interestingly some of those who had worked with IDOL referred to it
as "dated" and "clunky" in private conversations. I'm yet to get my
teeth stuck into IDOL personally so I'll reserve judgement but we
were consistently told throughout the day what the future of
content was and how certain practices were dated. On this subject I
feel compelled to make a point.</p><p><strong>A little rant:</strong></p><p>It is extremely hard to sit and be schooled about the "future"
by an organisation whose <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/">corporate website</a> and <a href="http://devnet.interwoven.com/">developer support site</a>
fail to implement some very basic web standards and best practices.
Validating your pages against your declared DTD, Providing RSS
Feeds and SEO friendly URLs are just a few extremely basic items
that a leading ECM vendor should take the time to implement. Oh,
and you can't search the developer site for key TeamSite
terminology like DCR, XML and TPL because they are too short.
They've been aware of this for years and it never changes.</p><p><strong>What I learned:</strong></p><p>A few quick bullet points:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=PRODUCT::TEAMSITE">
TeamSite</a> 7 and <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=PRODUCT::LIVESITE">
LiveSite</a> 7 to ship this year - focus will be on more IDOL
integration.</li><li>LiveSite runtime available for .net platform.</li><li>Autonomy pledged continued support for all Interwoven products
(including <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=PRODUCT::METATAGGER">
MetaTagger</a>).</li><li>Autonomy have doubled the number of trained support staff.</li></ul><p><strong>IDOL:</strong></p><p>We were introduced to <a href="http://www.autonomy.com/idolserver">IDOL server</a>
(Intelligent Data Operating Layer). TeamSite 6.7.2 SP1 ships with
IDOL server and from what I understand all content that is entered
into TeamSite is also consumed by IDOL via some kind of connector.
IDOL is able to analyse unstructured content from a variety of
sources - audio, video, email and many more - and "understand" it's
meaning. There are lots of technologies in play here - OCR, speech
to text, facial recognition to name a few - but the high level
concept is that you can throw just about anything at IDOL (with
minimal configuration) and it understands.</p><p>Let me explain a little about "understands". Like the rest of
the day the notion of content being understood was reasonably vague
but a lot of emotive language was used. IDOL can gauge sentiment,
mood, intimacy and so on. My interpretation is that Autonomy are
trying to tell us that their software is smart and it does all of
that classification, summarisation, stemming and synonym processing
without you having to think. They were also trying to tell us that
it does more than that, an example given was how a search for dogs
could yield results on Labradors and how IDOL may have a notion
that dogs are used by the police. Good stuff maybe, but a bit too
high level for my liking.</p><p>The demonstrations that we were given were unclear as to how
data is retrieved from IDOL though I got the impression that
SitePublisher components are shipped with the new version of
TeamSite which somehow query the IDOL repository. I was also left
unclear as to where IDOL sits within my environment - on the CMS
server, in my production environment - and what kind of hardware
resources it requires. I'm also wondering where the revenue comes
from - If we get IDOL server for free what do we have to buy? Are
we getting hooked on this new technology first and the paid for
stuff that we can't resist gets brought into play later?</p><p>To be honest it was a bit of an information overload with IDOL,
we saw it create tag clouds of user sentiment, create user
profiling, recognise people words and video and I must admit it
left me wanting to try it out. One point of note was that we were
shown a scenario where a customer dialling in to a call centre
casually mentioned the Chicago cubs and was presented with an
application form for a Cubs credit card the next time they visited
the company website. This may be fine in the US, I'd be a bit
careful about that kind of behaviour in Europe though - perhaps do
some reading up ob <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorm">PHORM</a>.</p><p>There was also an impressive demo of <a href="http://www.interwoven.com/components/pagenext.jsp?topic=PRODUCT::MEDIABIN">
MediaBin</a> combined with Autonomy Virage - now one product -which
was able to automatically transcribe a video audio track. The
demonstration ware pre-recorded. It would have been much more fun
to see a video of one the presentations on the day fed into the
software so we could see the actual real time results. Text to
speech is still far from perfect and audio tracks which aren't
clear and regional accents can still confuse the hell out of some
systems. If Autonomy wanted to show us how powerful their software
was they should have let a member of the audience talk to it.</p><p><strong>Integrated Analytics:</strong></p><p>Well no, not really. The new version of TeamSite allows you to
view some analytical data <strong>*if*</strong> you are a <a href="http://www.webtrends.com/">Webtrends</a> customer. To be
honest it wasn't that impressive it was just a bunch of standard
Webtrends reports linked to from the contentcenter GUI.</p><p><strong>Optimost:</strong></p><p>TeamSite 6.7.2 SP1 also has an optional (paid for) component
that allows you to test different permutations of a web page in
order to determine which was most successful - aka multi-variable
testing - success is gauged by the user reaching a 'goal' page on
your website. The permutations would be subtle copy or colour
changes in your website and you are able to rule out specific
permutations to gradually reach the 'winner' page. I wasn't sure
about this personally as I didn't like the idea of an ever changing
page and how this would affect it's page rank with search engines.
There was no demonstration of how the test results are presented
and whether it breaks users down by any demographics within the
results, but I did speak to a user from British Airways who was
very satisfied with the result that <a href="http://www.optimost.com/">Optimost</a> had yielded and he
claimed that the optimisations that they had made had easily paid
for the software in a very short space of time.</p><p><strong>A few moans:</strong></p><p>I didn't like the fact that the executive Q&amp;A session wasn't
opened up to the floor, we had to provide our questions on paper at
the end of the first session and they were vetted over the
following hour before the ones which were selected were asked to
the company executives on stage. I also thought that each
individual presentation could have been opened up to questions at
the end, but each presenter finished up exited the stage and the
next demonstration video kicked in.</p><p>In my opinion they could have easily lost a couple of sessions
such as Toby Bell of Gartner, a presentation from Fidelity on how
they built their new website and a Q&amp;A on e-commerce with some
executives of Autonomy Interwoven customers. I feel that these
would have been much better replaced with more audience
participation but then again Interwoven have always been quite a
closed organisation and I hear that Autonomy are even more so. For
the record I thought Toby Bell delivered a good presentation but it
didn't relate specifically to any Autonomy Interwoven products.</p><p><strong>To Conclude:</strong></p><p>All in all it was an interesting day. I'm looking forward to
getting my hands on some of the technology that Autonomy are
bringing to the Interwoven product suite. Unfortunately some of it
will be forever out of my reach as they don't really do
evaluations. There is a market for technical workshops where
developers like me get our hands on this technology maybe these
could run alongside gearup in future.</p><p>Claridges is a lovely hotel, lunch was fantastic and it was fun
to catch up with some old colleagues, meet some new people and put
faces to names of people that I knew by reputation.</p><p>I'd love to here some feedback from any other attendees. I'd
love to here from Autonomy Interwoven to see whether they think
I've been fair with my comments and particularly on whether they
plan to address any of the basic issues with their corporate sites
- I'm here and very willing to help if you want to be helped!</p><p>If what we saw yesterday is true IDOL Social Media Analysis will
probably read, classify and derive the meaning and sentiment of my
blog post and let someone at Autonomy know about it. For all I know
it may even respond automatically!</p><p>I'm sure I've missed something, but then a day with so much
detail is very difficult to summarise.</p>]]></bodyText>

  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>A while back I discussed the desire to have a document that
helped me to evaluate a web content management system from a
developer perspective. A few other people expressed interest in the
idea so I've published a very rough first draft here in case anyone
wishes to collaborate or provide any feedback.</p><p>The document is intended to be a verbose specification of a
simple website to build in the CMS the functionality of which is
extremely common to most websites. The exercise itself should take
no more than a day and leave a developer with a good feel of how to
perform basic tasks such as create content types and templates. The
simplicity of the exercise is such that I'd expect any reasonable
developer to be able to sit in front of a CMS they'd never used
before and hack their way through by Googling and badgering
experienced users on the CMS support site.</p><p>The feedback I'd like:</p><ul><li>Is there any *essential* website functionality that is
missing?</li><li>Is there anything in the document that isn't really in WCM
scope?</li><li>Any tips for structuring the document?</li><li>How to get the developer to write up the steps performed so you
could browse their evaluations to support your CMS selection.</li></ul><p><a href="/media/84160/WindowsLiveWriter_DeveloperWCMevaluationdocument_B6E5_Create%20a%20three%20page%20website.doc">
Here is the document</a></p><p>Feedback via comments or email is very welcome.</p>]]></bodyText>

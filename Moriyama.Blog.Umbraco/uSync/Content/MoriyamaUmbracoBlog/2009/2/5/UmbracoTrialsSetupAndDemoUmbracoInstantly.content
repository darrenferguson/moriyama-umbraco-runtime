  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>My new site <a href="http://autoumbraco.darren-ferguson.com/">http://autoumbraco.darren-ferguson.com/</a> allows you to install an instance of <a href="http://www.umbraco.org/">Umbraco</a> by filling out a web form which will take you less than 10 seconds. You can choose from version 3 and 4 and also specify whether you want any packages pre-installed – such as <a href="http://www.creativewebspecialist.co.uk/">Warren Buckley’s</a> excellent Creative website wizard.</p><p>Why is this useful? Scenario 1: you want to demonstrate Umbraco to a client/colleague who has never used it before. You are out of the office and don’t have IIS running on your laptop.</p><p>Scenario 2: You want to check out a new Umbraco package or test one that you are developing but you don’t want to install it into any of your development/production environments before you’ve tested the functionality.</p><p>Scenario 3: You want to run an event website for week or two while the event is on and then close the site immediately after.</p><p>I frequently need a fresh installation of Umbraco and am already finding this service very useful. I hope you do too.</p>]]></bodyText>

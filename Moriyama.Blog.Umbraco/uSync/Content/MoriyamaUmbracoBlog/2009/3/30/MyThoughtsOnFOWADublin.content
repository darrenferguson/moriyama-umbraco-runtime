  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>This post is a little late, I've been upgrading my blog.</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I attended the <a href="http://events.carsonified.com/fowa/A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/dublin/content">FOWA
"show" in Dublin</a>. The use of the word show is from the
organisers <a href="http://www.carsonified.com/">Carsonified</a> -
not myself - and there was definitely a frustrated rock star air to
the whole thing. Words/Phrases of the day were "Awesome" and
"Kick-Ass" and the fuck count was up in the twenties within the
first hour.</p><p>The highlights of FOWA for me were as follows:</p><p>Being introduced to <a href="http://www.balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq
Mockups</a> an nice little tool for producing wire-frames of web
page layouts, though as Elliott Kember points out - in a rather <a href="http://www.carsonified.com/web-apps/on-usability/">long
winded blog post</a> - it can be dangerous in the wrong hands.
Business users could suddenly think they are UI designers who can
do your job for you.</p><p><a href="http://simonwillison.net/">Simon Willison</a> gave a
good presentation on security. He talked about XSS and SQL
Injection which we should all know about but also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking">Click
Jacking</a>. If you aren't familiar with the latter then you should
be. In summary, consider the following when developing web
applications:</p><ul><li>Don't modify data in get requests.</li><li>Keep Sessions short.</li><li>Don't use a remember me function (either as a user or
developer).</li><li>Don't let your pages be loaded into iFrames - use frame busting
Javascript.</li><li>Add a hidden field to your forms containing a server generated
token which should be validated when a form is processed.</li></ul><p>I know I haven't given reasons for the bullet points above, but
they should be fairly obvious. Hopefully Simon's talk will appear
online somewhere.</p><p>Finally, <a href="http://www.abilitynet.org.uk/webteam">Robin
Christopherson</a> of ability net gave a presentation using a
screen reader. Interesting points raised were:</p><ul><li>Auto playing media with sound drowns out the voice of a screen
reader making it impossible to navigate a page.</li><li>Badly written alt tags really mess up the usability of a page.
Despite the fact this is such a well publicised issue massive
amounts of developers still don't provide meaningful alt tags.</li><li>The audio equivalent of Captchas are frequently unintelligible,
despite offering to provide manual assistance during signup large
organisations - including Google - frequently don't.</li></ul><p>I'm now committed to never placing a Capctha on any site that I
work on in the future.</p><p>Other than the above, the conference was largely uninspiring
(for me). <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/about.html">David
Heinemeier Hansson</a> from 37 Signals was entertaining but
delivered a motivational speech rather than anything technical. <a href="http://twitter.com/blaine">Blaine Cook</a> (of Twitter fame)
came frustratingly close to saying something interesting on several
occasions but ended up delivering a very high level and fluffy talk
on social networking. The guys from <a href="http://www.contrast.ie/">Contrast</a> had a good delivery
style, but I didn't need to be told that the web is full of
conventions and cliches, I work with it every day. I know.</p><p>Anyone else who spoke just fell of my radar. That isn't a
criticism, maybe I just wasn't the target audience. I know this
post may come across as being overly negative but it honestly isn't
intended that way. My kind of conference just involves more tech
and more innovative cutting edge stuff.</p><p>I'd be interested in going to FOWD in London, they have two
tracks as opposed to the one offered in Dublin so you can pick and
choose your speakers.</p><p>So that was my 5 minute summary of FOWA Dublin. There are a load
more posts all over the web complaining about the WIFI, coffee and
praising/slating various speakers. I've just picked out the bits
and pieces that were relevant to me.</p>]]></bodyText>

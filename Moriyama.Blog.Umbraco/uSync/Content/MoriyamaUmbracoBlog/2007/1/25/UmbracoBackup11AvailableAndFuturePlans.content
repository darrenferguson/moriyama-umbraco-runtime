Umbraco backup 1.1 is available for download. Although labelled beta, this release will only be updated if user bugs are 
reported in the next few weeks.
</p><p>
Before I give details on the product, a brief statement on the future of Umbraco Backup. 
</p><p>
Recently I have undertaken a contract
that is challenging to the extent that I don't have the drive for development in my spare time. Additionally my health has not 
been so good of late. As a result the only development on Umbraco backup will be bug fixes on issues reported by licensed users. 
This position may change in the future.
</p><p>
Now for some details of Umbraco Backup 1.1. Sorry if my grammar isn't great, I'm in a hurry today....
</p><p>
Firstly, all of the new features are a result of requests from users. Thanks for helping me to improve the software.
</p><p>
If you have an existing install of Umbraco backup, you can simply install 1.1 as you would any other Umbraco package and your software will be upgraded.
</p><p>
New Features:
</p><p>
1. People don't like registering and generating evaluation licenses, so this can now be done as part of the install.
</p><p>
2. Online help. A lot of users got confused with some of the information that you had to provide Umbraco Backup with. 
I added a help icon next to each option that causes confusion. Click on the icon to launch help.
</p><p>
3. Remember settings. Umbraco backup will now save the values entered so you don't need to type everything in each time you 
run a new backup.
</p><p>
4. Thread Context. Differences in IIS and different OS mean that sometimes unattended threads are terminated (probably as a security precaution).
You can now run Umbraco Bakcup within the context of an HTTP request if you are having problems with aborted threads.
</p><p>
5. Verify Path. Allows you to check that the web server user has the required permissions to backup under the specified path.
</p><p>
6. Test FTP settings. Check that Umbraco backup can communicate with your FTP server.
</p><p>
7. Allow backup under web root. Apparently some ISP's won't allow you write access outside of your document root. 
Umbraco Backup now allows you to backup under the docroot. I still don't recommend this unless you absolutely have to. 
If you are backing up under your docroot please remove the files created immediately after backup otherwise there is a 
real danger of goggle or some other bot indexing sensitive information about your site including the database connection string.
</p><p>
8. Real time backup progress information. By clicking 'Display backup monitor window' when initiating a backup you can see real time progress on what Umbraco backup 
is doing.
</p><p>
That's it for now. Please feel free to drop me any questions.
</p><p>
Many Thanks.
Darren.

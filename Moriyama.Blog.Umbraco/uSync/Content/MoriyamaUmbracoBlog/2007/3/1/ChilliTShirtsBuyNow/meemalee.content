  <bodyText><![CDATA[hi darren - bit skint at the moment so i won't order a tee just yet, but they do look really good :-)

anyway, i'm writing to let you know that i've just this minute got home from Hong Van (the place I told you to go, south of the river) and i took a print-out of the review you did to give to them. 

anyway, they were sooo chuffed that the manager gave us a free bottle of wine! 

it's actually got new owners now and it's been renamed "Cahn Buom" and has been refurbished, but it has the same staff and chefs so the food is just as good. you should go back when you get the chance - the menus bigger now - you can even get bun bo hue with extra pork knuckle!

keep on blogging...]]></bodyText>

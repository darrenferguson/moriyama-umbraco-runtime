I get quite a few questions about Umbraco Backup licensing, so here is clarification about what each licensing model means.
</p><p><b>Personal/Non-Profit:</b> For any type of not for profit web site e.g. charities and blogs. The license is tied to a fully qualified domain name e.g. www.mysite.com.
</p><p><b>Single Umbraco instance:</b> For a single commercial site, tied to domain name in the same way as a non-profit license is.
</p><p><b>Server license:</b> Allows you to install Umbraco Backup within as many Umbraco instances as you like on a single physical web server. All domain names for these sites *must* resolve to the same IP address. If you have two web servers you need two licenses. Changing the server IP is fine, the license is based on a domain, as long as all domains resolve to the IP of the licensed domain then your license is valid.
</p><p>
I am always happy to discuss volume licensing discounts, just drop me a mail.
</p><p>
I don't have any policy on upgrading to future versions yet. If you are waiting for version 2.0, there is really no point as I am not sure if there will ever be a 2.0 at present.

Thanks, Darren.

  <bodyText><![CDATA[Hi.  My son is getting married in the summer, and we wanted to have a vietnamese theme, as he and his wife will be going to live in Vietnam.  Although I am a caterer, I am loathe to try and produce the same outrageously delicious flavours as the Vietnamese do. My question is....do you think they would put together a VERY large takeaway (about 100 covers), just main course, that we could rush down to the country and reheat, or even choose things that are cold?? Thanks - I have tried ringing them, but language seems to be a bit of a barrier!!  
PS we live 2 hours away from London!

Thanks]]></bodyText>

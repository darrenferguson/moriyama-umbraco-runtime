<p>So I need to learn how to use <a
href="http://umbraco.codeplex.com/releases/view/79260">Umbraco
5</a> - because in a couple of months of time I'll be teaching it
to others. I've played with version 5 during development and
contributed a few bits of information back to the community but now
is the time to get real.</p>

<p>I always find that there is nothing like a real project when
learning a technology. I'd spent the last couple of weeks deciding
what would be my proof of concept project, a little afraid to
commit a client to such as breaking piece of tech and then it hit
me.</p>

<p>Gathering dust in a folder somewhere on my laptop was a set of
mock-ups for the new Ferguson Moriyama website. So why not?
Ferguson Moriyama on Umbraco 5 and blog and screencast about it
step by step so others can benefit from my experiences during the
process.</p>

<h2>A little project background</h2>

<p><a
href="http://www.fergusonmoriyama.com/">FergusonMoriyama.com</a>
has served me well since E15222D9-8D3D-45E6-8EC1-508D9DABEBB1 and Umbraco version 2.0.6. My company
website is (and always has been) a secondary channel when it comes
to new business. I'm fortunate enough to have enough repeat
business that I rarely have to convince people that we can help
them out.</p>

<p>Having said that the site does need a little TLC, In the 7 years
that the site has been in service we've diversified the types of
work we do and that obviously impacts the content we serve. From
being a pure services company we now sell some products and as we
provide training for which we need to take bookings.</p>

<p>In performing this technology refresh we'll get rid of some of
the "shoe-horning" and hacking of content that has gone before. It
used to be just me updating my Umbraco sites but now there are a
few of us, it'll be nice to remove those "special pages that only
Darren can edit".</p>

<h2>The Starting point</h2>

<p>The mark-up that I had built can be viewed on my preview
server:</p>

<ul>
<li><a
href="http://static.darren-ferguson.com/markup/home.html">Home
Page</a></li>

<li><a
href="http://static.darren-ferguson.com/markup/account.html">Form
Page</a></li>

<li><a
href="http://static.darren-ferguson.com/markup/products.html">Product
Page</a></li>

<li><a
href="http://static.darren-ferguson.com/markup/our_work.html">Client
Page</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When I undertook the refresh of the look and feel I had the
following criteria.</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistent positioning of content</li>

<li>Navigation to depth of 3 levels</li>

<li>Adding a standard form template</li>

<li>Adding a product template</li>

<li>Making our contact details more prominent to encourage people
to call us</li>

<li>Re-writing lots of the copy to focus on a smaller set of
services that we want to provide</li>
</ul>

<p>One concern is that I didn't really consider mobile devices very
well. In the last year I've started to use tablets and phones to
browse the site and I'm now kicking myself at the omission. Still
I've decided to move forward with what I have and address it as the
first issue post go live.</p>

<h2>The blog series</h2>

<p>I'll aim to write each step of this development up as I work on
it. I'll do my best to use screencasts and screen grabs where
appropriate. The aim is to make things fairly simple to follow and
the target audience will be people who are familiar with Umbraco
4.</p>

<p>I understand that I'm working with a product that is maturing
and expect to hit issues along the way - these will of course be
logged and reported. I'm not going to put a timescale on this or
commit to update the blog at regular intervals - I'm phenomenally
busy just now.</p>

<h2>Part 1</h2>

<p>In part 1 of this series (coming sometime soon) I'll look at two
things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Designing and implementing my document types</li>

<li>Versioning my development</li>
</ul>

<p>The versioning part will also consider a release process - Once
I've versioned my development I'll need to be able quickly release
iterations to multiple environments. At the end of each blog post
I'll plan to have the site public facing so you can follow my
progress.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>So before we start the build let's get a development environment
set up. This is really simple as I have the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx">Microsoft
web platform installer</a> and <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/">WebMatrix</a>
already on my machine.</p>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download <a
href="http://umbraco.codeplex.com/releases/view/80350#DownloadId=327116">
Umbraco 5 RC 2</a></li>

<li>Extract to a folder</li>

<li>Right click and choose <em>Open as a website with Microsoft
WebMatrix</em></li>

<li>Click run and choose a browser - in my case Chrome</li>

<li>On the splash screen click the <em>launch installer</em>
link</li>

<li>When prompted choose SQL CE as the database - I'll change this
later.</li>
</ol>

<p>That is all, an empty vanilla Umbraco 5 up and running. This
leaves me ready to start building my site.</p>

<p>The screencast below illustrates the steps described above.
There is no sound.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><em>Note: I installed the wrong version of
Umbraco in the cast but the process is the same.</em></p>

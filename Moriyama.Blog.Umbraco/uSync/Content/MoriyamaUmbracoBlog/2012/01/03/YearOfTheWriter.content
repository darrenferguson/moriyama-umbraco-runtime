<p>For some reason it is traditional at the end of each year to
reflect, self-criticise and create a personal development plan for
the coming year. The colloquial term - I believe - &nbsp;is <em>new
year resolutions</em>. I've resisted doing this all of my life,
knowing myself far too well to believe that I would ever stick to
any half arsed commitments &nbsp;- with me it has to be something
that I truly want to achieve.</p>

<p>I do something slightly different - each year for the past 3 or
4 years I've written a list of goals. At first glance they may
appear to be just another set of resolutions but I have a few
rules.</p>

<p>A goal needs to be positive and free of any negative
connotations, thinks like <em>"I must not"</em> or <em>"I will
not"</em> don't work for me. &nbsp;I also try and avoid any binary
goals that could be failed by a single action -&nbsp;<em>I will
exercise every day</em> can be broken by a day of abstinence <em>I
will exercise regularly</em> cannot.</p>

<p>For me my goals for the year should all be achievable, gradual,
measurable and inspirational - by gradual I mean a goal that I can
work on measuring success along the way and take small amounts of
satisfaction from my progress therefore keeping me
<em>inspired</em>.</p>

<p>So why am I telling you about this?</p>

<p><strong>My 1<sup>st</sup> goal for DD342A1F-588F-46F4-9806-89C04EE0A7AD:</strong>&nbsp;<em>To
write and Present more</em>.</p>

<p>In B25AC8DE-26FC-44E7-BB89-F200B2327094 one of my goals was to conquer a long term fear of
public speaking. The idea of standing up in front of a crowd of
people terrified me. The only way I knew to overcome &nbsp;this was
to put myself into the situation that scared me and confront it
head on.</p>

<p>Last year I spoke at CodeGarden 11 about <a
href="http://stream.umbraco.org/video/2196556/multi-language-websites-in">
multi-language websites in Umbraco</a> and at the Umbraco UK
festival about <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=S8evy72wpmM">
building commercial Umbraco packages and the Umbraco deli</a>.</p>

<p><em>The result?</em> I'm still alive. Although I could never
describe the experiences as being fun and comfortable I've
re-assured myself that I'm capable. Teaching the Umbraco Level 2
course prepared me by getting me used to presenting to small groups
of people. Some of my worries about public speaking were even
addressed in the classes, forgetting what I was going to say,
hecklers etc.</p>

<p>In DD342A1F-588F-46F4-9806-89C04EE0A7AD I'd like to get better at speaking in public, to be more
confident about it and maybe even to enjoy myself a little. The
second part of the goal is to write more.</p>

<p>When I was a kid I wanted to be a writer, all early school and
college reports stated <em>journalist</em> as my intended career.
Then something went wrong, my inner geek was somehow exposed and I
ended up programming computers. When I sat down to write out my
goals for this year I couldn't figure out how, when or why that
happened but I do remember that I loved to write.</p>

<p>I think that over the years my ability to write has been blunted
after churning out many hundred inane technical
<em>"specification"</em> documents. The goal for DD342A1F-588F-46F4-9806-89C04EE0A7AD is to get
back to loving to write, to strike a balance between sound
technical documentation and creative and informative articles.</p>

<p>So that is why you are reading this. I'm not going to do
anything silly like commit to blogging once a week - rewind to my
explanation offailure in a single actionearlier in this post. I'll
wrap up here and go and find some subject matter for these upcoming
blog posts.</p>

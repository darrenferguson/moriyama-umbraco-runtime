<p>With the release of Umbraco 5 upon us a there will be some
changes to the certification courses. <a
href="http://www.percipientstudios.com/">Doug Robar</a> and I
receive daily emails with questions about this so I thought I would
blog to clear up what will be happening.</p>

<p>The information in this course applies to UK courses only - it
is probably accurate for other courses too, but please check with
your local trainer before booking anything.</p>

<p>So without further ado, here is the Umbraco 5 training FAQ:</p>

<p><strong><em>Will you stop teaching Umbraco
4?&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>Yes, we will stop running public Umbraco 4 courses in the UK -
those listed for February will be the last, we won't schedule any
after that. Both Doug and I will be happy to teach Umbraco 4 at
your company office upon request.</p>

<p><strong><em>When will you start teaching Umbraco
5?</em></strong></p>

<p>March. We've scheduled some courses which are listed at <a
href="http://umbraco.com/products/training/schedule.aspx">http://umbraco.com/products/training/schedule.aspx</a></p>

<p><strong><em>Will my existing Umbraco certification become
invalid?</em></strong></p>

<p>No you are still an Umbraco certified developer;&nbsp; you will
still be listed on the Umbraco site. If you are a company that
holds solution provider status you will continue to do so.</p>

<p><strong><em>What is the Umbraco 4 to Umbraco 5 upgrade
course?</em></strong></p>

<p>For a <strong><em>very</em></strong> limited period we will be
able to offer upgrade courses. You will need to hold an existing
Level 2 certification to attend.</p>

<p>The courses are designed to quickly update certified developers
knowledge of Umbraco 4 so that is applicable to Umbraco 5. The
course runs two days and covers topics originally in the Level 1
and Level 2 courses.</p>

<p>Both Doug an I will teach this course. I'm really excited about
working with Doug - Without wishing to blow my own trumpet I think
this is a great opportunity to work with both of us over two days.
We'll take you for a beer too!</p>

<p><strong><em>Can you do onsite Umbraco 5
training?</em></strong></p>

<p>Yes, I'll be happy to book in dates for on-site Umbraco 5
training with you.</p>

<p><strong><em>I have another question!</em></strong></p>

<p>Just post your question in the comments here and I'll add it to
this post an answer it.</p>

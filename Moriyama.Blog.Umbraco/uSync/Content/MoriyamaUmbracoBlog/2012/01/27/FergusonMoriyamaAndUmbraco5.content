<p><strong><em>Before I begin, a dedication - I wouldn't have got
through this blog post unless I had the wonderful Matt Brailsford,
Doug Robar and Sebastiaan Jansen as Skype contacts - these guys are
MVP for a reason! #h5yr</em></strong></p>

<p>Yesterday I started to build the new Ferguson Moriyama website
in Umbraco 5, and as promised in my previous blog post I've
documented the process.</p>

<p>I've started out by designing the document types for the new
Ferguson Moriyama site as I usually would. As people maybe
following this as a tutorial I've done a better job of documenting
these than I usually would for a normal internal project.</p>

<p>The document types are deliberately as minimal as possible my
current site suffers from bloat where I put in fields for edge
cases that never emerged - things like alternative titles to be
used in place of node names and alternative dates to be used in
place of the default publish date. This time I'll start with as
little as possible and build up. I'm told that deletion of document
type properties in Umbraco 5 is recoverable by rollback which is
great in terms of being agile with your document types.</p>

<p style="clear: both;"><em>(You can click on the image above to
view the Google document that I created)</em></p>

<p>As an aside I'll talk a little about my process. The document
above is expected to change during the process of the build. I'm a
firm believer in agility and in fact I believe it is almost
impossible to specify exactly what you want before you start
building. As I already mentioned, on a typical project I wouldn't
maintain such a document. I see Umbraco document types as "self
documenting" and for clients who demand formal specifications I'd
normally just generate the documentation from the real Umbraco
document types. Interestingly (possibly) this is how PDF creator
for Umbraco came into being.</p>

<p>The document above contains a few areas which are TBD (to be
determined) but I deliberately make assumptions based on Umbraco 4
knowing that I can return later as my knowledge of version 5
increases.</p>

<p><strong><em>Creating the document types</em></strong></p>

<p>So I head off to the settings section of Umbraco 5 armed with my
document type specs and everything looks reassuringly familiar.</p>

<p>I hesitate slightly creating a document type called
<strong><em>Master</em></strong> because it sounds a little too
generic and has some connotations of .net master pages but I let it
slide. As an aside I'd normally put a site specific prefix in front
of my document types but in this case I'm confident that this
instance of Umbraco will only ever host the Ferguson Moriyama
site.</p>

<p>The first new feature that I notice is stricter control over
document type inheritance; I like that by checking
<strong><em>Inheritable Only</em></strong> on the
<strong><em>Composition</em></strong> tab that I can say that this
document type cannot be directly created as an instance of a node.
Being a pedant I'm also pleased to see the <strong><em>Generic
Properties</em></strong> tab is now called <strong><em>General
Properties</em></strong> :)</p>

<p><a href="/media/127947/2.png"><img src="~/media/127947/2_498x275.jpg"  width="498"  height="275" alt="2.png"/></a></p>

<p style="clear: both;">After 30 minutes or so of playing, Umbraco
5 looks to be in a satisfyingly familiar state. I hit one or two
snags - the one that sticks in memory is that I couldn't add
properties to inherited tabs but I am told that this is just a
temporary glitch.</p>

<p><strong><em>Create some nodes</em></strong></p>

<p>Document type hierarchy all worked in a familiar way - I headed
over to the Content section and created a Document of type
<strong><em>Home</em></strong> with two child nodes of type
<strong><em>Text Page</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Again, everything is looking pretty much as I'm used to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="/media/127952/3.png"><img src="~/media/127952/3_496x295.jpg"  width="496"  height="295" alt="3.png"/></a></p>

<p style="clear: both;"><strong><em>Add some
templates</em></strong></p>

<p>For now I decided to just add a Home Page template and output a
property or two, then I'll move on to versioning what I've built to
date. No CSS or anything to make the pages look pretty yet, just
some ugly markup.</p>

<p>Associating templates with document types is again a very
familiar experience to those of you who are familiar with Umbraco 4
- the big difference comes when creating templates, which are no
longer master pages but <strong><em>Razor views</em></strong>.</p>

<p>I spent a bit of time messing around here, and I understand that
some of the objects exposed to the view by default are subject to
change.</p>

<p>Umbraco 5 has a default template (or View) called
<strong><em>_Layout.cshtml</em></strong> which is in
<strong><em>~/Views/Umbraco</em></strong> this is synonymous to a
Master page in Umbraco 4 and will be familiar to those who have
adopted ASP.net MVC prior to looking into Umbraco v5. I'm not sure
if it is bad from to modify the default view but I do so.</p>

<p>At this stage I'm finding the terminology a little confusing,
the Umbraco 5 UI still uses the terminology
<strong><em>master</em></strong> and
<strong><em>template</em></strong> -I guess to remain familiar to
Umbraco 4 developers but there is a bit of internal conflict as my
mind thinks about <strong><em>Views</em></strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<a href="/media/127957/4.png"><img src="~/media/127957/4_498x275.jpg"  width="498"  height="275" alt="4.png"/></a></p>

<p style="clear: both;">I end up with the following layout which
does a few familiar things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Output document title</li>

<li>Output a (recursive) document type property</li>

<li>Render a child view</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Back it up</em></strong></p>

<p>So I've achieved a lot in a short space of time but before I go
I want to make sure that my customisations to Umbraco 5 are
versioned and separated in a way that I can roll them out to a new
version of Umbraco or revert to a previous version should I break
anything.</p>

<p><strong><em>Or maybe not</em></strong></p>

<p>I take a precursory glance over the database and the file system
and it isn't easy to figure out how document types are stored. I
find some information relating to my document types in a table
called <strong><em>AttributeSchemaDefinition</em></strong> but the
data model uses GUIDs as identifiers and there appear to be some
quite complex relationships between the tables. It certainly isn't
a 5 minute job to work out how it all hangs together.</p>

<p>My Umbraco HQ contacts aren't on Skype and I feel like I've
harassed them enough for today so I decide to quit for the day.</p>

<p>For now I'll backup my SQL CE database - after all it is just a
file - and I'll come back to this later when I have a bit more
energy. I'm really hoping that moving document types between
instances was a design consideration of Umbraco 5. Perhaps this is
where Courier vNext will come into play?</p>

<p><em><strong>Next Time</strong></em></p>

<p>I'll look at adding CSS and JavaScript to Umbraco 5 and
completing my homepage. I'll also look into how to create my top
navigation.</p>

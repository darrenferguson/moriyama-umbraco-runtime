<p>First and foremost,DO NOTgo and get this and try and install the
package over the top of a 0.1 blog extension. This isn't an upgrade
and I am afraidI CAN'T HELP YOUif you do this.</p>

<p>A couple of things I have done:<br />
 - added a resources folder into SVN that contains related HTML,
CSS and XSLT (these files were not in SVN). - added a release
folder into SVN that contains the latest and greatest .umb file
plus release notes. - added a bat file makePackage.bat that will
move dll's and .ascx controls into the resources folder named with
their appropriate GUID's and then assemble the package into the
release folder. Just run this in the project folder after you have
built in visual Studio to create a new .umb file.</p>

<p>I am working on an uninstaller for development, so you can test
the installer ascx without having to manually delete everything
from Umbraco each time you rebuild the project, but it isn't ready
yet.</p>

<p>Details of the enhancements are in the release notes.</p>

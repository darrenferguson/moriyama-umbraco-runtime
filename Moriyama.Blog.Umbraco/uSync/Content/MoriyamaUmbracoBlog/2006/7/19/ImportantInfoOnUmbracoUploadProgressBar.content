If you are having trouble with time-outs and my Umbraco upload progress bar please have a read of the section 'Using Location Filtering to Restrict/Modify NeatUpload's Request Processing' at 
<a href="http://www.brettle.com/NeatUpload-1.2/docs/Manual.html">http://www.brettle.com/NeatUpload-1.2/docs/Manual.html</a></p><p>
The following is from Morten Nielesen, who had some troubles getting large files to work.
</p><p>
tried tweaking the parameters but I was still get an error around 85% saying:
</p><p>
"Error: Thread was being aborted"
</p><p>
The file I was trying to upload is 18,607,377 bytes.
</p><p>
I have managed to upload a file at 13,172,394 bytes after retrying a couple of times.
</p><p>
Anyway I finally think I hacked it. Add the following to web.config:
</p><p>
&lt;system.web&gt;

   &lt;httpRuntime

    executionTimeout="600"

  /&gt;

 &lt;system.web&gt;
</p><p>
For some reason the asp.net worker thread aborts the thread before it has finished (so this is not an error in NeatUpload except how it keeps the thread alive)
</p><p>
Unfortunately it didn't work when I just added this to the /NeatUpload folder, so this is now a setting for all pages on the website.

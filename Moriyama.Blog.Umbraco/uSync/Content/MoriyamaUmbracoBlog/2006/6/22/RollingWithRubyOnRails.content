I've been hearing a lot of buzz about Ruby on Rails, so I finally got down to running through the tutorial at: <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/E15222D9-8D3D-45E6-8EC1-508D9DABEBB1/01/20/rails.html">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/E15222D9-8D3D-45E6-8EC1-508D9DABEBB1/01/20/rails.html</a></p><p>
Pretty impressive I must say, but the jury will be out until I get to try and build something ‘real world’ with it. This might not be for a while, as all of my spare ‘geek’ spare time is being invested in <a href="http://www.umbraco.org">Umbraco</a> at the moment. 
</p><p>
I am pretty sure it would handle any of the web projects that usually land at my feet, but it always comes down to whether I ‘like’ it or not.

Also, I did a brief search for UK based shared hosting packages that support ROR and only managed to find one.

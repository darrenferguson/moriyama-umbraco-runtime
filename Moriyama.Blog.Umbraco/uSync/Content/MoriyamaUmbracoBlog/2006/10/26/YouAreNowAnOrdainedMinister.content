 This is to confirm that</p>

 LONDON UK NW3 6AG UK</p>

<p>has been ordained as a minister of the Universal Life Church,

<p>Date of Ordination: 10/18/F56EAE9D-5A71-46C2-8973-4C0DCBF9211D</p>

 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>Your request for ordination has been processed, and you are now
an ordained minister of the Universal Life Church in Modesto,
California! Please record the above date of ordination for your
records, as you may need this information in the future to fill out
the various forms of the clergy. If you were ordained previously,
the above date will constitute a valid date upon which you were
RE-ordained. Ordination is for life, without price, and without
question of your specific beliefs. You do not need to pay any
tithe, donation, or offering of any kind, now or in the future.</p>

<p>Ordinations are individually reviewed and forwarded to Universal
Life Church International Headquarters in Modesto, California,
where it will be recorded in the permanent church records.</p>

<p>As a minister, you are authorized by the church to perform the
rites and ceremonies of the church (except circumcision), including
weddings, funerals, baptisms and blessings, subject to the laws of
your country, state, or locality. Prior to conducting any civil
ceremony (such as marriages), you should know and comply with the
laws pertaining to your area of jurisdiction.</p>

<p>You are entitled to all privileges and courtesies normally
offered to members of the clergy.</p>

<p>Your commitment is to always do the right thing. It is your
responsibility to peacefully and sincerely determine the right
course of action, and to avoid infringing on the rights of others.
You alone are responsible for your actions as a minister.</p>

<p>If you have not already done so, you may subscribe to our ULC
Newsletter online at http://subscribe.ulc.net</p>

<p>We have an online discussion forum where ULC ministers meet to
engage in fun and interesting communication. You are welcome to
join in. You'll find it at http://forum.ulc.net</p>

<p>You may also choose to have yourself listed in our online
directory. Please note that only those who have asked to be listed
in the directory are included (not all ministers). The directory
enables ULC folks to find one another, and is also a useful
resource for people looking for a ULC minister in their area to
perform ministerial services. You will find directory at
http://ulc.net/directory</p>

<p>We value and protect your privacy. Your name and other
information will not be made public on any listing unless you
specifically ask to be listed this way. Also, we will never furnish
your information to an outside agency, or allow it to be used for
any unrelated purpose.</p>

<p>It is not a piece of paper which makes you a minister. However,
many people wish to have a certificate, wallet card, or other
record of their status as a minister. Such items are particularly
useful to those who wish to perform marriages. It can serve to
reassure the bride and groom (or their parents!) of the legality of
the marriage.</p>

<p>Many ministers like to provide the couple with an authentic
Universal Life Church Marriage Certificate for them to include
among their wedding keepsakes. Others just want to have a
professionally printed certificate as a permanent record of their
ordination. With this in mind, we offer an assortment of Clergy
Packages to help you get started quickly and easily in your
ministry. These packages contain various documents, literature, and
helps for various situations. Details on the contents of these
packages follows at the end of this message. Please understand
however, that you are not required or expected to purchase
anything, and these items are not necessary for you to have an
effective and meaningful ministry.</p>

delivery. You may use our online shopping cart to prepare your
order, even if you prefer to mail your payment. At "checkout" you
will have the option to print your order ready to mail. Or just

<p class="clear">Three and a half chilli rated</p>

<p>We normally provide a link to another site, but this is newly
opened and I can't find it mentioned anywhere else online.<br />
 60-64 Kingsland Road, London E2</p>

<p>Excitedly we thought that this was somehow related to its
legendary namesake on the same street, but it became quickly
apparent that it isn't. An obvious attempt at cashing in on the
Kingsland road success story the soup here is good but not great.
On most other London streets you'd get away with it, but on the
kingsland road, this place will never stand out.</p>

<p>Good for: Service was very friendly.<br />
 Bad for: It's a bring your own - though some people like this as
it is cheap.</p>

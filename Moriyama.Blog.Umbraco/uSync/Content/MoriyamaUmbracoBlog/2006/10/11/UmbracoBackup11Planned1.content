<p>I am planning to work on a 1.1 release of Umbraco backup this
weekend to incorporate a couple of extra features that have been
requested by users.</p>

<p>The additional functionality will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remember settings from the last backup</li>

<li>Test FTP connection before starting backup</li>

<li>View/Remove previous backups from the server</li>

<li>Allow deletion of backups from the server after successful
FTP</li>
</ul>

<p>I will also be removing the need to register and generate a
trial license before you download. I've noticed that more than half
of people who register for a trial give up before generating a
license. I'm guessing that many more have given up before
registration.</p>

<p>The evaluation period will be extended to 30 days.</p>

<p>There have been more suggestions, a lot of which will go into
2.0. But unfortunately, the time I have at the moment is very
limited, so I can't speculate as to when 2.0 will be available.</p>

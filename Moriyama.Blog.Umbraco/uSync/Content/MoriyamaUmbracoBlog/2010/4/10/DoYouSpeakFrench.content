Me: Hello.<br />
Him: Do you speak French?<br />
Me: No.<br />
Him: Oh, not even a little bit?<br />
Me: No.<br />
Him: Errr, OK so you don't speak any French?<br />
Me: That is an accurate summary of our conversation so far, so what can I.....<br />
Him: [cutting me off] I'm looking for an Interwoven consultant, but they must speak French.<br />
Me: Well, I think we've established that there isn't a conversation to have.<br />
[Long pause]<br />
Him: So you don't speak French....<br />
Me: No.<br />
Him: Do you know anyone who speaks French?<br />
Me: Yes, quite a few people.<br />
Him: Great, well do you think...<br />
[cutting him off]<br />
Me: But not with Interwoven skills.<br />
Him: Oh, well thankyou. Bye.

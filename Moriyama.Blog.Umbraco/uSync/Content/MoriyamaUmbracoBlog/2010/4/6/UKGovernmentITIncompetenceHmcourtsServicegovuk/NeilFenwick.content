  <bodyText><![CDATA[I've filled out one of those forms before.  Ended up typing in a word processor to do my char/line count for me.  But I'm a web developer too and have a little imagination when it comes to problem solving.  It is a waste of money building a website to try to increase efficiency, if that website is not accessible to the widest possible audience.

Two things:

No more than 1080 characters:  I'll bet that there's no javascript counter to tell you how many you've used so far. I wonder if it crossed the minds of civil service that it might not be efficient to count to 1080 manually... nah.

Internet Explorer only:
See this petition on the number10.gov.uk website http://petitions.number10.gov.uk/ie6upgrade/ and note that it only stops canvassing in Feb B25AC8DE-26FC-44E7-BB89-F200B2327094, let alone getting through to the people who count.  I think we'll are a LONG way off getting them to change from IE-only. My guess - minimum turnaround of a year to test browser compatibility and that's only if they don't have internal software that has IE-only specifications.

I wonder what would happen if you replied with some links to accessibility laws and refer them back to their response :-P

I'll second you for any appointment as web advisor to government :)]]></bodyText>

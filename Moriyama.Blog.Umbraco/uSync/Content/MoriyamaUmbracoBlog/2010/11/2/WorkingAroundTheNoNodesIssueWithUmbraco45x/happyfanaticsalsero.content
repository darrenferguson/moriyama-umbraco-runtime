  <bodyText><![CDATA[Hi Darren,

Thanks a lot for your weblog about this issue (and posts on our.umbraco.org) as I've just had a nasty occurence myself. My hosting company had some deadlocks on a database which had to restart... and because of a websitepanel upgrade IIS was restarted as well. Although it seems unlikely this will reproduce a lot of times, it may and I want to apply a fix.

How do I put the custom nonodes page in place? Just make an aspx with your code and put it in the umbraco root? Or will I need to perform any other tricks?

Kind regards & thanks in advance,
HFS]]></bodyText>

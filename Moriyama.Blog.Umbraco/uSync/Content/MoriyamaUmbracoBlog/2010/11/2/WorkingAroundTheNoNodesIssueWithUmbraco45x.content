  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Updated</strong>: I've added some code to the
snippet below to see if you have an empty cache before doing the
republish.</em></p><p>A while back I <a href="http://our.umbraco.org/forum/ourumb-dev-forum/bugs/13649-Site-repeatedly-reverting-to-no-nodes-splash-page?p=0">
ran into an issue</a> where this site would regularly go off line
and revert to the Umbraco "no nodes" splash page that you usually
get post install.</p><p>As the forum thread explains this seems to be an issue
introduced in Umbraco 4.5.x where the content cache can't be
created on startup if SQL server is unavailable (I presume it just
fell back to the old cache in previous versions). I was getting the
issue on a regular basis as my hosting provider had enabled my
server to auto restart after installing windows updates. When the
server started up there was a race condition between the SQL server
and IIS services - more often than not IIS would start first and
SQL would not be available.</p><p>The solution was to Republish the cache manually via the Umbraco
GUI once all services were up. Not wanting to have to do this every
time I delved into the source and found the following code.</p><pre class="brush: csharp;">
Server.ScriptTimeout = 100000;
var cacheFile = IOHelper.MapPath("~/App_Data/umbraco.config");
            
var r = XmlReader.Create(cacheFile, new XmlReaderSettings() { DtdProcessing = DtdProcessing.Ignore });
var d = new XmlDocument();
d.Load(r);

var n = d.SelectSingleNode("//root");
if (n.ChildNodes.Count != 0) return;

Document.RePublishAll();
library.RefreshContent();
</pre><p>So, rather than do the republish manually every time the issue
occurs, I've replaced the out of the box noNodes.aspx with a page
that executes the code above and does a redirect to the
referer.</p><p>The correct solution of course would to be able to control the
order in which services on the server come up. But this may suffice
as a nice little workaround for any of you experiencing the same
problems.</p>]]></bodyText>

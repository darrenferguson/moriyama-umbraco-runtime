  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>I've been invited to participate in a Microsoft initiative in
which they will sponsor the development of some packages for
Umbraco. These packages will showcase Microsoft technologies and is
part of a wider effort to engage with Open source communities.</p><p>The guys below are also participating so be sure to read their
blogs in the coming weeks:</p><ul class="noindent"><li><a href="http://boxbinary.com">Alex Norcliffe</a></li><li><a href="http://www.creativewebspecialist.co.uk/">Warren
Buckley</a></li><li><a href="http://munkimagik.wordpress.com">Tim Saunders</a></li><li><a href="http://ismailmayat.wordpress.com">Ismail
Mayat</a></li><li><a href="http://www.wishfulcode.com">Peter Miller</a></li></ul><p>We've spent some time discussing ideas for useful Umbraco
packages and have come up with a few that we think are winners.
I'll write in more depth next week about what we are planning but
my participation will be around a package that provides better
access to the Umbraco media section and provides a whole bunch of
extra functionality around media.</p><p>As part of this exercise we'll have access to some interesting
Microsoft products, in particular I'll get a chance to work with <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a> and the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/expression/">expression suite</a> of
products. On a personal note this is also a fantastic opportunity
for me to gain access to some of the Microsoft product teams and
gain some new development skills.</p><p>We've been asked to blog regularly as part of the project so
you'll see a few posts here in the coming weeks. We've also been
asked to keep video diaries of our experiences with an emphasis on
our experiences using the Microsoft products - these will be
published through some Microsoft websites - more details to
follow.</p><p>Although this is a Microsoft sponsored initiative we are free to
express honest and frank opinions on our experiences so don't
expect any <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blog/A002C30F-7550-4AB9-A7FD-54C7A6D4EBA2/sep/23/windows-7-party">
Windows 7 party videos</a>! We've been told that our feedback
negative and positive will be valued and passed back to the
appropriate product teams and we've already seen from our initial
gatherings that the team at Microsoft are keen to help solve our
day today CMS tech problems.</p><p>Finally: I've got some Swag to give away! Check the next blog
post for details.</p>]]></bodyText>

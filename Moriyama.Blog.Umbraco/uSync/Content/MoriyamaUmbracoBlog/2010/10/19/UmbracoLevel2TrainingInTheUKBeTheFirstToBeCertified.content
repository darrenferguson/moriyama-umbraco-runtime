  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>After meeting with Niels before the Umbraco UK festival last
week I am pleased to announce that I'll be offering Umbraco Level 2
training and certification in the UK through my company Ferguson
Moriyama.</p><p>I've only just agreed to take on the training so there are no
firm details yet but you can keep up to date by following <a href="http://twitter.com/fmoriyama">@fmoriyama</a> on twitter or by
sending me an email using this <a href="http://www.fergusonmoriyama.com/contact.aspx">contact
form</a>.</p><p>One of the first tasks is to update my site giving full details
of what the training involves along with the prices, practicalities
and sign up forms. You can expect this information to be online
towards the end of this week.</p><p>Finally if you want the chance to be among the first to be
Umbraco Level 2 certified in the UK then read on.</p><p>Within the next few weeks I'll be doing a "test course" to help
me get a little bit of practice in a classroom situation. This
course will lead to certification and I'd like 5 experienced
Umbraco guys to come along. In return for easing me in to being a
trainer you'll get a discount of nearly half the usual price.</p><p>Places on this course are on a first come first served basis so
please email with your details as soon as possible.</p><p>Hope to be training you soon!</p>]]></bodyText>

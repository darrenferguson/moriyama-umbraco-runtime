  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>The first UK Umbraco level 2 training and certification course
is now <a href="http://umbraco.org/products/training/schedule/view?id=18">listed
on Umbraco.org</a> and available to <a href="http://www.fergusonmoriyama.com/umbraco-training.aspx#item-3">
book through Ferguson Moriyama</a>. The course will be on December
the 2nd and 3rd at <a href="http://www.etcvenues.co.uk/venues/bonhill-house">Bonhill
House in London</a>. Spaces are limited so early reservation is
recommended.</p><p>It has been a mad few days getting the infrastructure to run the
courses in place, but I've prepared a test run with 6 brave test
course atendees who will be coming to London in the next couple of
weeks.</p><p>I've spent a large amount of time in the last few days learning
the course materials and adding to them where I see appropriate and
I'm excited an looking forward to getting out there and getting
more people into Umbraco.</p><p>I must admit I'm slightly daunted by the atendee list for the
test course. The collective Umbraco knowledge in the room is going
to be quite something. We've got a current MVP and at least one or
two guys who are destined to be MVPs of the future. I'm working
hard to be on a par with these guys and have got  a few off
piste activities to challenge those who finish up their excercises
too quickly!</p><p>Also - I've noticed that my test course falls on the eve of the
<a href="http://thecogworks.co.uk/">cogworks</a> monthly <a href="http://www.meetup.com/The-London-Umbraco-Meetup/calendar/14902922/t/nr1o_grp/?rv=nr1o">
Umbraco social in London</a> so I'll be persuading my atendees to
come along for what should be a pretty good turn out. Hope to see
you all there.</p><p>Now back to Linq2Umbraco practice :)</p>]]></bodyText>

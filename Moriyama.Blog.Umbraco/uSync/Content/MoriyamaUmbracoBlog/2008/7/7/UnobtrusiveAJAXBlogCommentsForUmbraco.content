  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>Recently I've been building a lot of sites that make use of AJAX
using <a href="http://extjs.com">extJS</a> and <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, but hadn't really worked with
any AJAX in .net.</p><p>As an experimental project I decide to build unobtrusive AJAX
blog comments for this blog - which are now live.</p><p>My goals were:</p><ul><li>Include a spam filtering service - <a href="http://www.defensio.com/">defensio</a></li><li>Unobtrusive - work without JavaScript enabled</li><li>Identical UI with/without JavaScript</li></ul><p>I achieved about 90% of what I wanted.</p><p>In the end, the comments utilise an asp.net UpdatePanel. I
looked at Page Methods and Umbraco base but in the end went with
the UpdatePanel in order to use the standard asp.net validation
controls and a ValidationSummary. In my mind the main disadvantage
of UpdatePanel - aka partial page loads - is the amount of data
exchanged between server and client, but in the end I figured that
I probably don't have that many readers who are going to be put off
by a 40k round trip.</p><p>The whole process was a lot more painful than anticipated. The
ValidationSummary control forces a page to scroll to the top when
it appears. Lots of blog searching was required to find a hack to
get around that. There were several similar irritating issues.</p><p>I use jQuery to add the comment to the page on successful
submission as the comment list is rendered using an Umbraco XSLT
Macro.</p><p>There are a couple of glitches that I couldn't get around.
Firstly when JavaScript is disabled a submit of the comments form
leaves you at the top of the page, I couldn't find any way to
anchor a postback to the comments form. Second, my Umbraco macro to
display the comments seems to get run before the new comment is
created in Umbraco so you have to refresh to view your new comment
- again only when JavaScript is disabled.</p><p>I'd like to add some effects so that the comments and validation
messages appear with some kind of fade effect but it does get
tricky to try and override MS default behaviour.</p><p>The code is at best hacked right now. If you'd like a copy, drop
me a mail. I'll look at making it nicer and 'packaging' it should
the interest arise.</p><p>Finally I just need to give a few credits. <a href="http://www.objects.dk/">Per</a> for building the .net API for
defensio, <a href="http://www.creativewebspecialist.co.uk/">Warren</a> for some
CSS I stole from his blog :) and anyone else who participated in <a href="http://forum.umbraco.org/yaf_postst5291_Has-anyone-implemented-AJAX-blog-comments-with-net-AJAX-extensions.aspx">
this thread</a>.</p><p>Oh, and Peter D got this finished before me. His implementation
is <a href="http://www.dijksterhuis.nu/blog/9997642C-5F5C-4A03-A353-2E7B493113A9/6/29/ajax-comments.aspx">
here</a>, but I still think it is worth posting this as our
approaches vary somewhat.</p>]]></bodyText>

  <bodyText><![CDATA[<p>My site is back online after a little enforced downtime. I was having real stability problems using a WebFusion VPS and as far as I am concerned their introductory VPS package is unfit for purpose. I'd strongly recommend that you don't attempt to host an Umbraco site with them.</p><p>The more eagle eyed amongst you may notice that a couple of posts went missing. I'll just say that I have learned the hard way to check whether my scheduled database backups are running or not.</p><p>Anyway, I am back up and running on a dedicated server. Hopefully my site(s) should be a little more stable now.</p>]]></bodyText>

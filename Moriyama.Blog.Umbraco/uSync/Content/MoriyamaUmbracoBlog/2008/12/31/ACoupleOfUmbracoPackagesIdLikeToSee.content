<p>I'm really happy with Umbraco as a blogging tool since I got
livewriter support hooked up writing a blog post is now an
extremely quick process and I don't need to worry about anything
expect the content of the post.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was sat thinking about what tools would improve the
quality of my posts and came up with a couple of ideas for Umbraco
packages that I would like to see. As time is limited and I'm not
sure I'll have the time to build these packages I thought I'd
outline my ideas here and possibly inspire someone else to pick up
the ideas and run with them.</p>

<p>The first idea is the more simple of the two. I'd like that when
I publish a blog post that certain keywords are automatically
linked to URLs. For example the word Umbraco always gets linked to
umbraco.org or the phrase Liverpool gets linked to the official
Liverpool website. These words and phrases would need to be setup
in a configuration file.</p>

<p>I could see this idea working as an Action Handler or some kind
of button on the TinyMCE toolbar. The latter is probably a better
idea as you may only want to add links to certain blog posts. You'd
also want to verify the links that had been added to the blog post
in case the code had made any mistakes.</p>

<p>The code itself would be pretty trivial. Just some regular
expressions parsing your blog post body.</p>

<p>The benefit of this functionality is that you can enhance your
search engine rankings by having reciprocal links with other sites
and manually adding these links to each post can get quite time
consuming. I may get around to building this functionality myself
it is probably only a few hours work.</p>

<p>My second idea is a little more abstract and probably needs some
more thought. I'm painfully aware that my blog looks rather plain.
The blogs that stand out for me use some kind of relevant images
within the body of the post.</p>

<p>The idea of going and sourcing an image for every post I make is
quite painful. What I'd like is something that would auto suggest
some images based on the tags and body content of a post.</p>

<p>I'm speculating that the functionality would search either the
Umbraco media section or some kind of online public image library
(or both). With events in Umbraco 4 I'm imagining it would be quite
easy to create a Lucene index of media items. Some kind of
classifier may be used against the body of the blog post in order
to determine the keywords for the post.</p>

<p>Again, I Imagine some kind of button on the TinyMCE toolbar
opening a popup with thumbnails of suggested images. When a
thumbnail is clicked the image is inserted to the post body with
any required scaling performed automatically.</p>

<p>So, those are my thoughts. It turned into a bit of a longer post
than I imagined. If nothing else, it serves as a reminder to myself
when I'm looking for a new project.</p>

I've created a package to check for broken links in Umbraco pages. You can download it <a href="/media/12892/ferguson_moriyama_link_checker_1.0.umb">here</a>.
</p><p>
While reading through some of the notes on open space sessions conducted as part of codegarden day 2 I saw this requested as a 'most wanted' package. I remembered that I had the code to do this from a couple of years ago, so I cleaned it up a little and decided to release it.
</p><p>
The package is implemented as an Umbraco action handler. When you publish a node, it's content is scanned for broken links. If any are found then a report is emailed to the document publisher. You need to have Umbraco configured so it is able to send email.
</p><p>
The package will handle external links as well as internal absolute and relative links.
</p><p>
As ever, thoughts, suggestions, comments and feature requests are all welcome.

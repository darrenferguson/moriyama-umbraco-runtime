(used to be a http://www.iview-multimedia.com/)\n\nI've used it for years for cataloging my photos as have thousands of other photographers as it was the best too out there for a long time.\n\nI am sure tight integration with Expression Media would be of great benefit to a lot of users who now use it.\n\nCheers,\n\nChris",

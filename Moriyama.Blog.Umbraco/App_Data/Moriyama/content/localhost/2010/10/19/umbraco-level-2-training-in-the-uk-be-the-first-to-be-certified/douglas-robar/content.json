    "bodyText": "I couldn't be more excited to have Darren leading the Level 2 courses in the UK along side the Level 1 courses I provide. Finally, the UK has easy access to both certifications! \n\nDarren's a great guy, fantastically capable, and has a gift for explaining things clearly. \n\nSign up and get your Level 2 Certification! You'll be very glad you did.\n\n(And no, you don't need to take the Level 1 first. As the umbraco training faq says... \"as long as you know the basics of umbraco you'll be able to enjoy the Level 2 course. However, we do recommend taking the Level 1 course to get all the basics right, even if you find your self a skilled umbraco implementator - there's a lot of gems and best practices covered in the Level 1 course\")\n\ncheers,\ndoug.",

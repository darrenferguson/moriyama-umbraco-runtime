    "bodyText": "Totally agree about the Agents. I have had it with them. I tried a couple last year due to having too little time selling myself within projects.\r\nMy conclusion after 1 year is that 99% are totally useless and incompetent lazy bastards. They put zero effort into learning the technologies and just shoot with very wide nets, thus destroying your reputation by sending you to the wrong type of jobs. Their idea seems to be to make money with minimum effort, burning all sorts of bridges while doing it. Never again I say, now it is all about networking.",

    "bodyText": "\r\n<p>I've posted <a\r\nhref=\"http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/how-tos/how-to-highlight-text-in-examine-search-results\">\r\na wiki page</a> over at our umbraco that shows how to highlight\r\nsearch terms in <a href=\"http://examine.codeplex.com/\">Umbraco\r\nexamine</a> searches using <a\r\nhref=\"http://lucene.apache.org/lucene.net/docs/2.0/Highlighter.Net/Lucene.Net.Highlight.html\">\r\nLucene.Net.Highlight</a>. Source code is attached to the wiki\r\npost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The code was lifted from an <a\r\nhref=\"http://our.umbraco.org/forum/developers/extending-umbraco/13571-Umbraco-Examine-Search-Results-Highlighting\">\r\noriginal forum post</a> by <a\r\nhref=\"http://twitter.com/ismailmayat\">Ismail</a> so credit to him -\r\nI wouldn't have known where to start otherwise. Also thanks to <a\r\nhref=\"http://twitter.com/shazwazza\">Shannon</a> who made a quick\r\nchange in the latest version of examine to make the highlighting\r\neasier and faster to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you get the code up and running the result is quite\r\npleasing - the highlighter will highlight terms even if you are\r\nusing fuzzy terms derived from your original search text:</p>\r\n\r\n<div><img src=\"/media/77659/14239_1.png\" alt=\"Examine Highlighting\"/></div>\r\n\r\n<p>I'd classify this is a 30 minute hack. I don't fully understand\r\nthe inner workings of what i've put together. The code effectively\r\ndoes a search within a search against the query results to perform\r\nthe highlighting so I am sure there are efficiency gains to be had.\r\nYou can see from the screenshot above that highlighting takes\r\nlonger than the original search against the text.</p>\r\n",

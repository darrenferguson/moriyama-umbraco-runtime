    "bodyText": "IMHO this debate about price is simple economics.  If you really are over pricing your product then there will be \"money on the table\" and someone will step in and offer your product at the right quality, right time and crucially a price the customers can bear.\n\nBut that's not the case, you have sufficient demand, there is no unused inventory in your business (spare time that could earn money), so why compromise on price.\n\nMy business is in its infancy and I tend to price on a number of factors, including the supply of time I have available, the demand for that time, and what I think the customer can bear.  \n\nMy preference is to make sure the requirements are well defined and working at a fixed price, because the client is protected against the risk of the project overrunning and in reality I am usually rewarded for accepting the risk.  But the trick then is to spot the weakly defined projects that can sap your time and potential earnings.",

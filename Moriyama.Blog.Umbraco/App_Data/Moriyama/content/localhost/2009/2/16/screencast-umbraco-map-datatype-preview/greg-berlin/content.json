I'm currently upgrading my blog and getting it all ready for my travel adventures (I'm exploring SE Asia for 3 months from March to June).... this would be absolutely perfect for showing my location in the world.\n\nI was going to do a Virtual Maps macro or data type, but have run out of time so glad u've beaten me to it.

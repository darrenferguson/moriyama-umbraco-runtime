    "bodyText": "Couldn't you just use characters without the accents?\nYes, agree it's crap, but \"Vasteras\" without the accents above the a's is probably all you had to do?\n\nGov contracts can be ludicrous.\n\nBasically, people leave school, work as a junior in local govt or similar, learn VB and think they are a developer.\n\nThen they leave - create a rubbish app in aforementioned VB4 - and sell it back to local gov / NHS.\n\nHappens a LOT.\n\nLocal NHS paid millions for a similar crappy system. Kinda like nepotism.\n\nBut complaining will get you no where.\n\nMajority of gov IT are self taught and those that aren't are too busy fighting the incompetents.\n\nA lot like working for other overly large organizations such as Ford.\n\nBy all means be annoyed.\n\nBut would changing the name to use the 'a's without accents have solved the problem?",

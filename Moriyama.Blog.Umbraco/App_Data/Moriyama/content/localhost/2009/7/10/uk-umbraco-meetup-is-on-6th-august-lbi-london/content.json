Spaces are limited so please don't leave it until the\r\nlast minute. Please sign up on the page rather than just commenting\r\nin the forum as I need to provide a list of people to the venue on\r\nthe day.</p><p><strong>We need your help!</strong></p><p>Although most of the practical details are in place there is\r\nplenty the Umbraco community can do to support this event.</p><p><strong>Give a presentation</strong></p><p>If you think that you have a compelling talk/presentation to\r\ngive at the event, please leave some details on <a href=\"http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/codegarden-2009/umbraco-uk-meetup/topicspresentations\">\r\nthis wiki page</a> or contact me <a href=\"http://www.fergusonmoriyama.com/contact.aspx\">by\r\nemail</a>.</p><p><strong>Tweet/Blog/Email your friends</strong></p><p>Be sure to let any UK Umbraco users know about the event by\r\nsending links to the wiki pages above. Use the hashtag\r\n#umbracouk.</p><p>Non Umbracians are welcome there will be plenty of beginner\r\nfocused material. If you know any CMS professionals who may be\r\ninterested in Umbraco get them to come along.</p><p><strong>Come along prepared to participate</strong></p><p>We don't want the meet-up to be a bunch of guys standing up and\r\ntalking we want to have group sessions and may be some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology\">open\r\nspace</a>. Come along prepared to speak up, with questions and\r\ntopics around Umbraco in mind.</p><p><strong>Finally</strong></p><p>Without community partcipation this event will just be some tech\r\nguys in a room. By contributing to the wiki pages above and\r\nthrowing your suggestions into the ring we can make it something\r\nmuch more than that.</p>",

    "bodyText": "Thanks for posting this. According to my understanding of Tom's response, he gave Interwoven a very believable 37/45. One of the lowest, hence most believable, scores. Which is why you didn't rip them to shreds :-) He didn't claim that eval versions were available, so no arguments there either. An honest response all in all.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you can see my scoring of Tom's original response and some discussion on the validity of some of the questions here (read Kas' comments too):\r\n\r\nhttp://jonontech.com/2009/03/25/celebrity-cms-deathmatch-part-3/\r\n\r\nI agree with you about the Online Docs. Not sure I agree about the reboot.",

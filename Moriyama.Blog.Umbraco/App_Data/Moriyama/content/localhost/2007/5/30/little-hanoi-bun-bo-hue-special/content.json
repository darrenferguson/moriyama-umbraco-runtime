All we had to do was bring a big enough\r\ngroup to eat it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say the result was superb, best we've ever had.\r\nUnfortunately we can't rate it as you can't just walk in off the\r\nstreet and order it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can get a big enough group (10 or more together) I'm sure\r\nAndy will get it together for you. Needless to say, drop us an\r\nemail so we can come along too!</p>\r\n",

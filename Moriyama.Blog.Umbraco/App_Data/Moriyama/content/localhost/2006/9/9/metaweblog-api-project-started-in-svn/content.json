I know a couple of other Umbraco developers were interested in this functionality so I have put it in SVN with the other Umbraco extensions.\r\n</p><p>\r\nsvn://svn.umbraco.org/var/lib/svn/umbraco-extensions/UmbracoMetaWeblogAPI\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs I am really busy at the moment it is unlikely I will be able to do anything with this for a while. If you want to contribute to finishing it off, drop me a mail and I can run you though how to get it up and running.\r\n</p>",

    "bodyText": "<p>\r\nAfter a lot of frustration trying to implement content search in Umbraco yesterday I decided that this article may be a good idea.\r\n</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Umbraco/Samples_and_Articles/Implementing_Search\">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Umbraco/Samples_and_Articles/Implementing_Search</a></p><p>\r\nI wrote it all in one quick sitting, so I havenâ€™t had time to go through it with a fine tooth comb yet and check the spelling and grammar.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe more I write tutorials and docs, the more I become convinced that screencasts are better, so I will try and create the article as a screencast too. \r\n</p>",

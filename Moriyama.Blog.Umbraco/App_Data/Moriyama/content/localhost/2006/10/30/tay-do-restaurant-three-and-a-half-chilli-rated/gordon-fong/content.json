    "bodyText": "When I went it was during one of the hottest days of summer 2005 and it was swealtering. However, it this probably gave it an even more authentic feel seeing as Hanoi city probably rates the same in terms of heat and humidity.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the place, even if I had to constantly fan myself with the menu. The waiter had to prise it away from my hands to give it to another customer, who then promptly kept it to fan himself!\r\n\r\nAfterwards, we walked up and down the same street and saw other Vietnamese restaurants open but none of them were anywhere near as busy as this one.",

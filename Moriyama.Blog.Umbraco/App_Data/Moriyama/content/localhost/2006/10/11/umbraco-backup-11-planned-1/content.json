    "bodyText": "\r\n<p>I am planning to work on a 1.1 release of Umbraco backup this\r\nweekend to incorporate a couple of extra features that have been\r\nrequested by users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The additional functionality will be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Remember settings from the last backup</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Test FTP connection before starting backup</li>\r\n\r\n<li>View/Remove previous backups from the server</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Allow deletion of backups from the server after successful\r\nFTP</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>I will also be removing the need to register and generate a\r\ntrial license before you download. I've noticed that more than half\r\nof people who register for a trial give up before generating a\r\nlicense. I'm guessing that many more have given up before\r\nregistration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The evaluation period will be extended to 30 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There have been more suggestions, a lot of which will go into\r\n2.0. But unfortunately, the time I have at the moment is very\r\nlimited, so I can't speculate as to when 2.0 will be available.</p>\r\n",

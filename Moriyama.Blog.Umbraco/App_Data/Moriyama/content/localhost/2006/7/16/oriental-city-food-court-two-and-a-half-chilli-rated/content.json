We had the Bun Hue, the\r\nstock was great, but the beef was very very fatty (is this\r\ntraditional vietnamese style or not?).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note: The rating is subject to change as food stalls change\r\nownership on quite a frequent basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/39926591@N00/190679902/\"\r\ntitle=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"/media/77278/1558_2.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Oriental City food court - Two and a half chilli rated\"/></a></p>\r\n",

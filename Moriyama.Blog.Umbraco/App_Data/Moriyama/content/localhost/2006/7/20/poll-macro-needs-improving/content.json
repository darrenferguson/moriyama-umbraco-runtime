    "bodyText": "\r\n<p>A while back I posted a <a\r\nhref=\"http://www.darren-ferguson.com/2006/07/08/a-poll-macro-for-umbraco.aspx\">\r\nPoll macro for Umbraco</a>. There was a reasonable amount of\r\ninterest, so I posted the source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the original post says, this was just a very quick demo and I\r\nthought that the method of storing responses would need\r\nimproving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hartvig.com/\">Niels</a> posted a link to the\r\ndemo on the <a href=\"http://www.umbraco.org\">Umbraco</a> site and\r\nas a result it got several hundred responses which slows down\r\nUmbraco when trying to acess the node where the responses are\r\nstored in the GUI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This post is just to advise against using this Macro on\r\nproduction systems until I (or someone else) get the chance to\r\nimprove it.</p>\r\n",

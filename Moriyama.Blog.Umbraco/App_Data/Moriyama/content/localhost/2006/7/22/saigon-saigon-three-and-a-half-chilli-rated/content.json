The food took 25 minutes to arrive and\r\nthe stock being warm rather than hot were two of the main niggles.\r\nThis place is definitely much more restaurant than a quick bite to\r\neat cafe that we normally go to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the plus side, the stock had good flavour and was very\r\ndifferent from anything on our quest so far, not so sure about the\r\nmixed meats and the lack of chilli sauce on the tables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had number 69 - Bo Bun Hue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/darrenferguson/195473343/\"\r\ntitle=\"Photo Sharing\"><img src=\"/media/77290/1614_2.jpg\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Saigon Saigon - Three and a half chilli rated\"/></a></p>\r\n",
